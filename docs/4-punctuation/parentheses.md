# Parentheses

[info] **Highlight:** Use parentheses sparingly. [/info]  

Avoid using parentheses in standard sentences unless absolutely needed. Readers tend to overlook content inside parentheses, so avoid enclosing important information in them. Consider rephrasing your sentences even for lesser important information as well. You can use [em dashes](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/dashes/#em-dashes), [commas](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/commas/), [semicolons](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/semicolons/), or [periods](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/periods/) to provide emphasis for parenthetical phrases.

## General dos and don'ts for parentheses

- When referring to a sign or symbol, introduce its spelled out version and then the sign or symbol in parentheses.  
  **Examples**<br>
  [tip] **Recommended:** Use an em dash (â€”) also known as a long dash, to set off a break in the flow of a sentence. [/tip]  
  [tip] **Recommended:** End the tag with a greater than (>) symbol. [/tip]  
- If parentheses are introduced inside a sentence, then don't capitalize the first word even if the enclosed sentence is a complete sentence. Capitalize the first word of the sentence enclosed in parentheses if it is a proper noun.
  **Examples**<br>
  [warning] **Not recommended:** Emphasize on the task to be accomplished (The task that you're writing about), rather than how the user should interact with the UI element. [/warning]

- Don't use parentheses within parentheses for text. Rephrase the sentence if necessary.
- Use brackets to set off information already within parentheses.
- If a complete, independent sentence is enclosed within parentheses, include the period or comma inside the parentheses.
- Place colons and semicolons outside parentheses.
- Place question marks and exclamation points inside the parentheses only when they're part of the parenthetical phrase.
- Be watchful of misplaced, unopened, or unclosed parentheses.
