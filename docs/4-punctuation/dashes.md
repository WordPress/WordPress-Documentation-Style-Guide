# Dashes

## Em dashes

Use an em dash (—) also known as a long dash, to set off a break in the flow of a sentence. Em dashes are also used to provide emphasis for parenthetical phrases more than parentheses themselves. Don't add spaces before and after the em dash. Don’t capitalize the first word after an em dash unless the word is a proper noun.

Use one em dash on each side of the phrase that is to be embedded.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** You can edit your theme — including the appearance, colors, and design — in the `styles.css` file.  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** You can edit your theme—including the appearance, colors, and design—in the `styles.css` file. [/tip]

You can also use one em dash to initiate a phrase at the end of a sentence.

Don't use an em dash as a bullet in a list. See [Lists]() for additional information. Avoid using an em dash to indicate empty or unoccupied elements such as text fields, cells, and other values.

### Typing em dashes

**HTML**  
``&mdash;``  

**macOS**  
Press <kbd>Option+Shift+hyphen</kbd>.  

**Linux desktop environment**  
Enable the <kbd>Compose</kbd> key. (Instructions for doing that vary depending on your Linux distribution.) After the Compose key is enabled, you can create an em dash by typing the <kbd>Compose</kbd> key followed by three hyphens.  

Alternatively, press <kbd>Control+Shift+U</kbd>, then let go of those keys, then type <kbd>2014</kbd>, then press either the <kbd>Return</kbd> key or the <kbd>Ctrl/Shift</kbd> keys.

Note: These Linux options don't work if you're signed in to the Linux command line from a remote system using ssh or the like; you have to be in a Linux desktop environment.  

**Windows**  
Turn num lock on, then hold down the left <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and type <kbd>0151</kbd> on the numeric keypad.  

## En dashes

En dashes are generally used to indicate a range of numbers, the minus sign, or negative numbers. Although you can use en dashes for these purposes, you can also use hyphens or the word *to* for numerical ranges.

Use an en dash indicate a range of numbers such as values or dates. Don't add spaces before and after the en dash.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The program was under active development from 2012 – 2017.  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The program was under active development from 2012–2017. [/tip]
[tip] **Recommended:** Select a range from 10–60 px as the width of the button. [/tip]

Use an en dash to indicate negative numbers and the minus sign. While writing an equation with a minus sign, insert spaces before and after the minus (en dash). Contrarily, while writing a negative sign (en dash), don't insert a space after it but do insert one before the sign.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** Enter the CAPTCHA: 20–6=14.  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Enter the CAPTCHA: 20 – 6 = 14. [/tip]

[warning] **Not recommended:** The value of the variable must be– 3.  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The value of the variable must be –3. [/tip]

For additional information, see [Range of numbers]().

Don't use an en dash as a bullet in a list. See [Lists]() for additional information. Avoid using an em dash to indicate empty or unoccupied elements such as text fields, cells, and other values.

Don't use an en dash to indicate a range of times. Use the word *to* instead of the en dash. Use an en dash with no surrounding spaces for a schedule or listing.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:** The server was down from 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The meeting is scheduled from 15:00–16:00 UTC. [/tip]  

In contrast, for date ranges consisting of two dates and times, use an en dash with spaces surrounding the dash.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:** 7:30 AM–9:15 AM 05/11/2020 (time range on a single day) [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 7:30 AM 04/11/2020 – 9:15 AM 05/11/2020 (date and time range) [/tip]  

For additional information, refer [Dates and Times]().

## Colons instead of dashes in lists

Sometimes writers use em dashes, en dashes, or hyphens surrounded by spaces in lists to separate a title or heading with its description. Ideally, use colons or [description lists]() for separating them.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** Getting started with WordPress hooks - Introduction  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Getting started with WordPress hooks: Introduction [/tip]

[warning] **Not recommended:** You can install WordPress on one of the following operating systems – Windows, macOS, or Linux.  [/warning]
