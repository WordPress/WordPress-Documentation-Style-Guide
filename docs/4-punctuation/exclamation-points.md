# Exclamation points

[info] **Highlight:** Only use exclamation points unless absolutely needed, except in code examples. [/info]  

Use exclamation points in documentation unless absolutely needed. Use exclamation points sparingly except in code examples.  
Rather than using exclamation points to express important content, you can use [notices](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/notices/) such as *__Warning__, __Note__,* or *__Caution__*.
