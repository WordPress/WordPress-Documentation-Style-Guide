# Apostrophes

Use curved apostrophes, the same character as a single quotation mark ('). Only use straight apostrophes in code snippets.

## Apostrophes in contractions

Use an apostrophe to indicate the letters omitted in contractions.

**Examples**  

- *I'm - I am*.
- *they've - they have*.
- *don't - do not*.

Refer "Contractions" for additional information.

## Apostrophes in plurals

Don't use apostrophes to form plurals of nouns and abbreviations.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: *page's, FAQ's.*  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: *pages, FAQs.* [/tip]  

To pluralize a number, add an *-s* at the end without any apostrophe.

**Examples**  

- The 2000s.
- Type five 7s.

Don't add an apostrophe and *s* in abbreviations of measurements to indicate plurality. For example, 50 mi or 10 mm; not 50 mis, 50 mi's, 10 mms, or 10 mm's.

Avoid pluralizing symbols, signs, and individual letters by adding an apostrophe and an *s* at the end.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Invalid characters include x's, $'s, @'s, and #'s. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Invalid characters include the letter *x* and the symbols $, @, and #. [/tip]  

Refer "Plurals" for additional information.

## Apostrophes in possessives

Use an apostrophe to form the possessive case of nouns. To form the possessive case of a singular noun, add an apostrophe and an *s*, even if the noun ends with an *-s, -x,* or *-z*. For plurals ending with an *-s*, add an apostrophe only.

**Examples**  

- John's software
- Buzz's laptop
- application's password
- bus's architecture
- class's description
- CSS's file
- OEMs' products
- business' earnings
- classes' declaration
- Jones' programs

**Exception:** If a proper noun ends with an *s*, you can either use an apostrophe and *s* or just an apostrophe.  
**Exception:** The possessive of *it* is *its* and doesn't have an apostrophe. Be wary of common mistakes such as confusing *you're* (a contraction for *you are*) with *your*, and *its* with *it's* (a contraction for *it is*).

Don't use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns.  

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The website is your's. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The website is yours. [/tip]

Add an apostrophe and *s* to the end of a company, product, or brand name. In general, avoid forming possessives of company, product or brand names, regardless of who owns the name.  
Refer "possessives" for additional information.
