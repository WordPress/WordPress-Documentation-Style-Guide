# Commas

## Oxford/Serial commas

Use the Oxford comma before the conjunction in a series of three or more items.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural and friendly towards the reader. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural, and friendly towards the reader. [/tip]

## Commas following an introductory phrase

Use a comma after an introductory word or phrase.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Ultimately this simplifies the reader's comprehension. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Ultimately, this simplifies the reader's comprehension. [/tip]

## Commas separating two independent clauses

Use a comma to join two independent clauses which are separated by a conjunction such as *and, or, nor, but, for, so, yet.* Insert the comma after the first clause, that is before the conjunction. Don't insert a comma if both the clauses are very short. Likewise, consider rewriting the sentence if it is long and complex.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Copy the file, and continue.[/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Copy the file and continue. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: Either download a theme suiting your needs or use one from the preinstalled themes. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Either download a theme suiting your needs, or use one that is preinstalled. [/tip]

**Note:** Don't use a comma to join independent clauses when you don't use a conjunction. Use a semicolon instead.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Copy the file, then continue. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Copy the file; then continue. [/tip]

## Commas separating independent from dependent clauses

When an independent and dependent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, insert a comma *only if* the sentence could be misunderstood without one.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Pages can be password protected and can only be modified by administrators. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Pages can be password protected, and can only be modified by administrators. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: Permalinks are permanent URLs, and their structure can be changed. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Permalinks are permanent URLs and their structure can be changed. [/tip]

## Commas separating two or more adjectives in series

Use a comma to separate two or more adjectives that precede a noun that is being described. Only insert a comma if the meaning of the adjectives doesn't change by separating the adjectives with *and* or reversing the order of them.

**Examples**

[tip] Recommended: Gutenberg is a new, intuitive block-editor. [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: This is an enhanced, mobile UI. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: This is an enhanced mobile UI. [/tip]

Rewrite sentences for a conversational style and tone if possible.

**Examples**

[tip] Sometimes okay: Write accessible, inclusive documentation. [/tip]
[tip] Recommended: Write documentation that is accessible and inclusive of all readers. [/tip]  

## Commas and other clauses

Generally, it is beneficial to use commas for setting off specific kinds of clauses for better comprehension.
- Use a comma before the word *which* at the beginning of a nonrestrictive clause. See "Pronouns - Relative pronouns" for additional details.

## Commas and numbers

Use a comma to separate the year when writing a complete date. Don't insert a comma between the month and year when a specific date isn't mentioned.
