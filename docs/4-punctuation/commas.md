# Commas

[info] **Highlight:** Use commas to separate items in a series, and to separate certain kinds of clauses. Use serial commas. [/info]  

## Oxford/Serial commas

Use the Oxford comma before the conjunction in a series of three or more items.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural and friendly towards the reader. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural, and friendly towards the reader. [/tip]  

## Commas following an introductory phrase

Use a comma after an introductory word or phrase.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Ultimately this simplifies the reader's comprehension. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Ultimately, this simplifies the reader's comprehension. [/tip]  

## Commas separating two independent clauses

Use a comma to join two independent clauses which are separated by a conjunction such as *and, or, nor, but, for, so, yet.* Insert the comma after the first clause, that is before the conjunction. Don't insert a comma if both the clauses are very short. Likewise, consider rewriting the sentence if it is long and complex.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Copy the file, and continue.[/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Copy the file and continue. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Either download a theme suiting your needs or use one from the preinstalled themes. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Either download a theme suiting your needs, or use one that is preinstalled. [/tip]  

[info] **Note:** Don't use a comma to join independent clauses when you don't use a conjunction. Use a [semicolon](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/semicolons/#semicolons-between-two-independent-clauses) instead. [/info]  

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Copy the file, then continue. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Copy the file; then continue. [/tip]  

## Commas separating independent from dependent clauses

When an independent and dependent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, insert a comma *only if* the sentence could be misunderstood without one.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Pages can be password protected and can only be modified by administrators. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Pages can be password protected, and can only be modified by administrators. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Permalinks are permanent URLs, and their structure can be changed. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Permalinks are permanent URLs and their structure can be changed. [/tip]  

## Commas separating two or more adjectives in series

Use a comma to separate two or more adjectives that precede a noun that is being described. Only insert a comma if the meaning of the adjectives doesn't change by separating the adjectives with *and* or reversing the order of them.

**Examples**  
[tip] **Recommended:** Gutenberg is a new, intuitive block-editor. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** This is an enhanced, mobile UI. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** This is an enhanced mobile UI. [/tip]  

Rewrite sentences for a conversational style and tone if possible.

**Examples**  
[tip] **Sometimes okay:** Write accessible, inclusive documentation. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Write documentation that is accessible and inclusive of all readers. [/tip]  

## Commas and other clauses

Generally, it is beneficial to use commas for setting off specific kinds of clauses for better comprehension.
- Use a comma before the word *which* at the beginning of a nonrestrictive clause. For more information, see [Relative pronouns](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/language-grammar/pronouns/#relative-pronouns).
- Put a semicolon, period, or a dash before a conjunctive adverb such as *therefore, hence, besides, however*, and insert a comma after the adverb.
- Don't use a comma before the causal conjunction *because* unless it is being used at the start of a nonrestrictive clause.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Click the button which has a dropdown menu. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Click the button, which has a dropdown menu. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Input the data in the field otherwise the program won't work. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Input the data in the field; otherwise, the program won't work. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** The command won't function, because it has been deprecated. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The command won't function because it has been deprecated. [/tip]  

## Commas and numbers

Use a comma to separate the year when writing a complete date. Don't insert a comma between the month and year when a specific date isn't mentioned.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** This article was updated in September, 2020 by the author. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** This article was updated in September 2020 by the author. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** This article was updated on September 13 2020 by the author. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** This article was updated on September 13, 2020, by the author.  [/tip]

## Commas with verbs in a compound predicate

Don't insert a comma between verbs in a compound predicate. A compound predicate is when two or more verbs pertain to a single subject.
In general, rewrite a compound predicate in two sentences, or add a subject for the second verb.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** The application parses the data, and displays it in the terminal. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The application parses the data. Then it displays the data in the terminal. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The application parses the data, and then it displays the data in the terminal. [/tip]
