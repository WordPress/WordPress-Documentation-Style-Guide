# Semicolons

[info] **Highlight:** Use semicolons to separate independent clauses. [/info]

Generally, sentences with semicolons are complicated and are often difficult to comprehend for readers. Try to simplify sentences containing semicolons by rephrasing, splitting, or itemizing them. In general, use semicolons judiciously.

## Semicolons between two independent clauses

Use a semicolon between two closely associated independent clauses that aren't joined by a conjunction, where a comma or period isn't quite pertinent.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: Upload the file; then click **Continue**. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: There are multiple different block types that are available; a list of blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/blocks/). [/tip]

## Semicolons before an independent clause

Use a semicolon before an independent clause that is set off with phrases such as *for example, that is, in particular*, or *to illustrate*.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: The preview shows how the page will look on the front end; that is, the final published website. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: Making changes to the code while running the server could cause errors in your databases; specifically, corrupted tables or duplicate values. [/tip]

## Semicolons before a conjunctive adverb

Insert a semicolon before conjunctive adverbs that join two independent clauses. Examples of commonly used conjunctive adverbs include *accordingly, additionally, also, besides, consequently, finally, furthermore, hence, however, indeed, in fact, likewise, similarly, therefore*, and *thus*.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: You can drag and drop the block if you select it; similarly, you can also use the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to move the block. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: After you re-run the application, the page gets updated; however, you'll need to refresh the page in the browser too. [/tip]

Use a semicolon between two contrasting statements that aren't joined by a conjunction.

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended: You don't need top specs to run WordPress locally; a simple configuration would be totally adequate. [/tip]
