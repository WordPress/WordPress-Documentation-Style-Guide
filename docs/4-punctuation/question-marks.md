# Question marks

[info] **Highlight:** Use question marks sparingly. [/info]  

Use questions sparingly. Documentation is supposed to provide the readers with information rather than asking questions.

You can ask questions from the reader's point of view. Also, it is acceptable to use questions in quoted text from user interface elements, FAQs, or reader questions.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Did you forget your password? [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** If you forgot your password, follow these steps. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** What does it mean if I see a message saying: "Error Code 345. Do you want to continue?" [/tip]
