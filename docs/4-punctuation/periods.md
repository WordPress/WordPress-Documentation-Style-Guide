# Periods

[info] **Highlight:** End all independent sentences with a period, and insert one space after the period. [/info]  

End all independent sentences with a period, and insert one space after the period. If the sentence or phrase ends with punctuation other than a period, such as a question mark or exclamation point, don't use a period.

## Periods with lists

Ending a list item with a period depends on several factors including the kind of list the item appears in.

For more information, see [Lists](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/lists/).

### Bulleted and numbered lists

In general, use a period at the end of each item in bulleted and numbered lists.  

**Exceptions:** Single-word items, items entirely in code font, and items with no verbs.  

For more information, see [Capitalization and punctuation in lists](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/lists/#capitalization-and-punctuation).

### Description lists

Don't insert a period at the end of a term, and insert a period at the end of a description.

## Periods with URLs

Ending a URL or file path immediately with a period may confuse readers and even alter the URL.

If the period isn't part of the URL, you can differentiate it by highlighting it different than normal text. In most browsers, a link is highlighted blue by default, which helps to differentiate it from the period. When you put a period after a URL, don't leave any space between the last character of the URL and the period.

To indicate that the period ending a sentence is not a part of the URL, you can rewrite the sentence so that the URL isn't at the end. Another alternative is to exclude the period by putting the URL on a separate line other than the text.

## Periods with parentheses

If the last part of a sentence ends within parentheses, insert the period after the closing parenthesis. If a complete, independent sentence is enclosed within parentheses, include the period inside the parentheses.

**Examples**  
[tip] **Recommended:** You can categorize your post with multiple tags (the default tag is uncategorized). [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Making changes to the code while running the server could cause errors in your databases. (Specifically, it can cause corrupted tables or duplicate values.) [/tip]  

## Periods with quotation marks

If a sentence or phrase ends with content inside quotation marks, place the period inside the quotation marks, even if it doesn't belong in the quoted content. If the sentence or phrase inside the quotation marks ends with punctuation other than a period, such as a question mark or exclamation point, don't use a period.

**Examples**  
[tip] **Recommended:** The developer said, "This API is the newest version." [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Regarding regular updates, the user asked, "When can we expect a version update?" [/tip]

Use periods at the end of shortened words. Don't use periods with acronyms and initialisms. Similarly, don't use periods with commons words that are abbreviations such as *app* or *demo*.

## Periods with numbers

Use a period to represent a decimal point.

## Periods with headings

Don't end headings, subheadings, or titles with periods.
