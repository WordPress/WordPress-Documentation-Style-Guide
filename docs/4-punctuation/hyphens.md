# Hyphens

[info] **Highlight:** Hyphenate words only when needed for clarity. [/info]

## Predicate adjectives

Don't hyphenate a predicate adjective unless specifically mentioned in the [Word list and usage disctionary](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/word-list/) or otherwise. An adjective predicate is an adjective that modifies the subject of the sentence. The adjective and the subject are connected by a linking verb.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The image needs to be high-resolution. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The image needs to be high resolution. [/tip]  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The document is up-to-date. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The document is up to date. [/tip]  

## Compound modifiers

Use hyphenated compound modifiers before a noun. A compound modifier (also known as a noun modifier) precede and modify the noun as a unit. Only hyphenate two or more words that precede and modify the noun as a unit of it doesn't result in undue confusion. Don't hyphenate a compound modifier when you use it after a noun.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** Don't use the recently deprecated tool. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Don't use the recently-deprecated tool. [/tip]

[warning] **Not recommended:** The high capacity website hosting is impressive. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The high-capacity website hosting is impressive. [/tip]

Hyphenate two or more words that precede and modify the noun:
- If one of the words is a past or present participle (a verb ending in *-ing* or *-ed* being used as an adjective or noun).  
 **Examples**  

 - well-formatted text
 - mind-stimulating blog
 - left-aligned paragraph  


- If the compound modifier is a number or a single letter with a noun or participle.  
 **Examples**  

 - three-pronged approach
 - Cartesian x-axis
 - 4-sided quadrilateral

In compound words that precede and modify a noun as a unit, don't hyphenate:
- The word *very* when it precedes another modifier.  
 **Examples**  

 - very high capacity  
 - very fast storage


- Adverbs ending in *-ly* when they precede another modifier. Don't hyphenate adverbs unless absolutely needed for clarity. If you're doubtful of a particular word being an adverb, first refer the [Word list and usage dictionary](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/word-list/); if it's not covered there, refer the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).   

 **Examples**  

 - highly intensive processing
 - readily available source code

## Compound words

When two or more words are joined to form a new word, it is called a compound word. Hyphenate compound nouns when one of the words is abbreviated.  

**Examples**  

- e-learning
- e-commerce

To determine if a particular word can be hyphenated or not, refer the [Word list and usage dictionary](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/word-list/). If you're doubtful of a particular word, and if it's not covered in the [Word list and usage dictionary](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/word-list/), refer the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

## Numbers and fractions

Hyphenate compound numerals and fractions.  

**Examples**  
- Jump to the thirty-second page in the user manual.
- Split the columns into one-thirds using the column block.  

[En dashes](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/dashes/#en-dashes) (–) are generally used to indicate a range of numbers, the minus sign, or negative numbers. Although you can use en dashes for these purposes, you can also use hyphens or the word *to* for numerical ranges. Use an en dash indicate a range of numbers such as values or dates. Don't add spaces before and after the en dash or the hyphen. Use an en dash instead of a hyphen in a compound adjective when the compound adjective includes an open compound.  

For more information, see [En dashes](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/dashes/#en-dashes), [Range of numbers](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/numbers/#range-of-numbers), and [Range of numbers with units](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/units-of-measurement/#ranges-of-numbers-with-units).

## Prefixes and suffixes

Avoid creating new words by adding [prefixes or suffixes](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/language-grammar/prefixes-suffixes/) to existing words. Rewrite the word to avoid creating a new word, so as to prevent any confusion.

Don't hyphenate a word that has a prefix or suffix, in the following situations:
- After these prefixes: *auto-, co-, cyber-, exa-, giga-, kilo-, mega-, micro-, non-, pre-,	re-, sub-, tera-, un-* unless excluding it could cause confusion.

Hyphenate a word that has a prefix or suffix, in the following situations:
- When not hyphenating results in a confusing word; for example, *non-native, re-count, re-mark*.
- When a number or a capital letter follows the prefix; for example, *non-English, pre-2000*.
- When the prefix is *self-*; for example, *self-diagnosis, self-exclusion*.
- When the prefix is followed by a word that is already hyphenated.
- When the prefix ends in a vowel, and the word it precedes starts with the same vowel; for example, *co-operate, anti-immune, re-establish*. [review]
- When the prefix is followed by a compound word that contains a space. In this case, the space is replaced with a hyphen; for example,  *world wide web* but *pre-world-wide-web media*.

For more information, see [Prefixes and suffixes](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/language-grammar/prefixes-suffixes/).

## Space around hyphens

Don't insert a space on either side of a hyphen, except when using a suspended hyphen, in which case insert a space after (but not before) the hyphen.

## Suspended hyphens

Don't use suspended compound modifiers that have a common base. You can either spell out the entire phrase, or leave a space after hyphen and leave out the base. Don’t form suspended compound modifiers from one-word adjectives.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** You can use either left, right, or center-aligned text formatting. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** You can use either left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned text formatting. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** You can use either left-, right-, or center-aligned text formatting. [/tip]  

## Capitalization in hyphenated compound words

Capitalize any part of a hyphenated compound word even if it isn't capitalized without a hyphen.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** well-formatted text is a vital element to enhance readability. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Well-formatted text is a vital element to enhance readability. [/tip]
