# Document structure

[info] **Highlight:** Follow a defined document structure throughout your documentation. [/info]  

- Don't write walls of text in your documentation. Follow a defined structure throughout your documentation.
- Break up long pages of text into paragraphs, lists, and illustrations. Use proper heading hierarchy.
- Maintain a uniform structure for your document. Emphasize important points both stylistically and visually.
- Use concise and simple sentence structures. Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural, and friendly towards the reader.

## Text formatting

- Use consistent typographic formatting and font sizes for your documentation.
- Use bold formatting for word emphasis and UI elements. Additionally, use italics formatting for names, terminology, etc.
- For more information, see [Accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/general-guidelines/accessibility/) and the [Formatting](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/) section.

## Encoding

- Ensure that proper character encoding is used. The UTF-8 character encoding is used universally, and is the preferred form of encoding.
- Unicode encoding is preferred because of its single character encoding, by which you can handle any specific character that is needed. Using Unicode throughout your system also removes the need to track and convert between various character encodings.
- Both developers and writers should use UTF-8 character encoding to ensure uniformity and eliminate inaccuracies in their content.
- For more information about character encoding, see [W3C - Character encodings for beginners](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding).
