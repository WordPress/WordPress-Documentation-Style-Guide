# Style and tone

<!-- https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/documentation-team-handbook/tone-and-voice-guide/-->
Always write your documents in simple, easy-to-understand sentences. Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural, and friendly towards the reader. Avoid a tone that is commanding or too pushy. Try to keep the document contents straightforward and effortless to understand.

Don't try to be overly colloquial. On the other hand, a formal or robotic tone is unfit as well. Try to achieve a balance between colloquial and formal language, that is suitable for providing knowledge and information. The document should persuade readers, rather than overwhelm them with verbiage.

Even if a conversational tone helps, don't overplay the humor part. Keep the emphasis on the reader; the reader should not feel out of place. WordPress is a global project, with the majority of users being non-native English speakers. Hence, take into consideration that your document may be translated into other languages. Ultimately, educating and providing information to the reader is of the utmost priority.

## Try to avoid these things

- Colloquial or idiomatic expressions.
- Unnecessary metaphors or humor.
- Technical jargon or slang.
- Shortcuts, symbols, and abbreviations that could easily be spelled out.
- Being overly pretentious or conspicuous.
- Dictating or ordering procedures in a condescending tone. For example, *You must click __Publish__* or *You need to click __Publish__*.
- Being overly polite. For example, *Please click __Publish__*.
- Using exclamation points unless absolutely needed.
- Capitalizing words where it is unnecessary.
- Excess use of the same phrases and pronouns.
- Ableist language or figures of speech.
- Long and complicated sentences.
- Content that would insult any group or individual.
- Assumptions on the reader's fundamental understandings.
- Using unorthodox conventions.
- Heavily biased and disparaging information.

Not complying to these guidelines may result in increased document perplexity and could impede the reader's understanding.

## Things that are encouraged

- If you are finding it difficult to achieve a suitable tone and structure, try seeking input from your counterparts.
- Proof-reading the document for the tone and structure.
- Overall simplicity of the document.
- Using transition words such as *moreover, although, hence,* and *therefore*.
- Using [active voice](//voice.md) wherever possible.
- Using [contractions]() such as *they've* and *don't*.
- Brief and concise sentences.
- Using [second person](//grammatical-person.md) by keeping emphasis on the reader such as *you*.
- Using conditional phrases.
- Defining technical terms, jargon, and [abbreviations]().
- Referring proven [research and facts](//facts-claims.md).
