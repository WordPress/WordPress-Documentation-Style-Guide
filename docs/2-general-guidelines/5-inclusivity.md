# Writing inclusive documentation

[info] **Highlight:** Write documentation using inclusive language, word choice, and examples. [/info]  

The WordPress community is welcoming and inclusive. Write WordPress documentation considering inclusivity of people of all demographics.

## Unbiased documentation

Write documentation that is unbiased towards the reader and any kind of person in general. While documenting particularly demanding/sensitive topics, take the time to educate yourself thoroughly. Ensure that your document doesn't have content that may hurt or offend someone unintentionally.  

While writing unbiased documentation:
- Be inclusive of gender identity, race, culture, ability, age, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class. Include a wide variety of professions, educational settings, locales, and economic settings in examples.
- Avoid politicized content. In case political content is to be included, remain neutral.
- Follow [accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/general-guidelines/accessibility/) guidelines.
- Avoid content that would insult or cause harm to people.
- Don't make any generalizations about people, countries, and cultures, not even positive or neutral generalizations.
- Don't write prejudiced and discriminatory content against minority communities.
- Avoid terms related to historical events.

### Replacing established terms

Various words that are deemed to be non-inclusive are often used in documentation. If replacing those terms causes confusion for readers, you can refer to the non-inclusive term in parentheses in the first use, and subsequently use the inclusive term throughout the rest of the document.

**Examples**  
[tip] **Recommended:** If `disallowed_keys` (sometimes called as `blacklist_keys`) exists in the database, the stored value will be returned. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** If `disallowed_keys` (previously known as `blacklist_keys`) exists in the database, the stored value will be returned. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The comment blocklist (sometimes called a *blacklist*) shows blocked and spam comments. Comments that are not on the blocklist are published. [/tip]  

| **Recommended** | **Not Recommended** |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| deny list, blocklist, disallowed, unapproved | blacklist |
| allowlist, allowed, approved | whitelist |
| main | master |
| primary/subordinate | master/slave |
| site admin, website author, web developer | webmaster |
| built-in, core | native |

## Avoid ableist and profane language

Be thoughtful of word choice - particularly slang and ableist language. Don't use slang, violent and derogatory language such as *dumbass* and *bitch*.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Gutenberg is damn useful stuff. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Gutenberg is a versatile editor. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Only morons use this API. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Using this API is not advised. [/tip]  

## Writing about genders

Use gender-neutral language, including pronouns. When writing about a real individual, use their preferred pronouns. Avoid gendered language such as *manpower*, *man-hours*, *chairman*, etc. For more information, see [Pronouns and genders](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/language-grammar/pronouns/#pronouns-and-genders) and [they, their, them](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/word-list/t/#they-their-them).  

**Examples**  

| **Recommended**      | **Not Recommended** |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| human-power, staff, personnel, workforce | manpower |
| humankind, humanity, people | man, mankind |
| operates, controls, utilizes | mans |
| manufactured | manmade |
| chairperson | chairman |
| everyone, folks, people | guys, gals, girls, boys |

Don't use *he, him, his, she, her, or hers* while refencing people. To write around pronouns, you can:
- Rewrite using the second person (*you*).
- Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun.
- Use the words *person* or *individual*.
- Use articles *the, an,* or *a* instead of a pronoun.
- Use a plural pronoun such as *they, their*, or *them*, even if it references a single individual.

When writing about a person, use the pronouns that the person prefers. Only use gendered pronouns such as *he, him, his, she, her, or hers,* or other pronouns if a particular individual prefers to be identified with them. It's acceptable to use gendered pronouns in direct quotations of people who prefer being identified with those pronouns.

## Using diverse examples

Represent diverse perspectives and scenarios in text and media. Make use of inclusive and a diverse range of names, ages, gender identities, locations, professions, and cultures while depicting people.
- Avoid making generalizations about people, religions, cultures, regions, and countries.
- Avoid unintentional racial and cultural bias while writing examples.  

## Accessibility and disability

- Research the terminology that the people with disability want to be identified with.
- Don't refer to people without disabilities as *normal, fit or healthy*; terms that would demean people with disabilities. This includes terms that are judgmental and victimize people with disabilities as *abnormal* or *sick*.  

### Accessibility terminology

| **Recommended**          | **Not Recommended** |

| person with disability | the disabled, handicapped, differently abled, challenged, abnormal |
