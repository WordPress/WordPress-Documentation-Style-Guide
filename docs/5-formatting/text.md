# Text formatting

[info] **Highlight:** Maintain consistent type and text formatting. [/info]  

Consistent text formatting and type treatment is a principal factor in great documentation and design. The intuitive use of text formatting, color combinations, alignment, spacing, and punctuation enables simplicity and improves readability for the reader.

Formatting text uniformly by utilizing distinct design and structures such as that in headings, tables, lists, URLs, and code examples helps distinguish information easily, while also making it easier for scannable and accessible documentation.

## Text highlighting

Text can be highlighted to distinguish itself from other text using the following text-formatting conventions:  

**Bold**  
Use bold formatting, `<b>` in HTML or `**` in Markdown for [UI elements](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/developer-content/ui-elements/) and at the beginning of [notices](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/notices/).

Although a double underscore (`__`) can be used for bold formatting in Markdown, it can be difficult to distinguish in a text editor. Preferably, use double asterisks (`**`) for bold formatting in Markdown.  

**Italic**  
Use italic formatting, `<i>` in HTML or `_` in Markdown, when drawing attention to a specific word or phrase, such as when defining or introducing [key terms](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/key-terms/) or using [words as words](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/words-as-words/). You can also use a single asterisk (`*`) for italic formatting in Markdown.  

**Underline**  
Do not underline.

**Strikethrough**  
Do not use strikethrough.

**Code text**  
Use `<code>` in HTML or ``` ` ``` in Markdown to apply a monospace font and other styling to [code in text](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/developer-content/code-in-text/), inline code, and user input.

Use `<pre>` in HTML or ` ``` ` in Markdown for [code examples](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/developer-content/code-examples/) or other blocks of code.

Do not override or modify font styles inline.

**Quotation marks**  
Use [quotation marks](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/quotation-marks/) in the American (US) English style.

**Capitalization**  
Use standard American (US) English [capitalization](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/language-grammar/capitalization/) rules. Use sentence-case capitalization in [headings, titles, and other content](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/headings/).

**Font**
Don't override global styles for font type, size, or color.

## Using type

Clear, legible, as well as aesthetically pleasing typography is one of the primary features in visually appealing content.

- In general, use sentence-case capitalization and avoid other forms of capitalization such as all-uppercase, all-lowercase, or title case.
  For more information, see [Capitalization](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/language-grammar/capitalization/).
- Use left alignment for text. This ensures an even left margin with a irregular right margin- improving document structure.
- Avoid center-aligned text.
- Ensure adequate and consistent line spacing - which is the amount of vertical space between two lines of text in a text body. If your site's design determines the line spacing, don't change it. Don't reduce line spacing to fit more text or content; rewrite or edit the text instead.
