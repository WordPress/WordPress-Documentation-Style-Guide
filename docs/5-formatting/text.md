# Text formatting

Consistent text formatting and type treatment is a principal factor in great documentation and design. The intuitive use of text formatting, color combinations, alignment, spacing, and punctuation enables simplicity and improves readability for the reader.

Uniform text formatting by utilizing distinct formatting such as headings, tables, lists, URLs, and code examples helps distinguish information easily, while also making it easier for scannable and accessible documentation.

## Spaces between sentences

Leave only one space between sentences; that is, leave only one space between the sentence-ending punctuation and the first character of the next sentence.
