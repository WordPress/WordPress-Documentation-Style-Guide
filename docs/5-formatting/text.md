# Text formatting

Consistent text formatting and type treatment is a principal factor in great documentation and design. The intuitive use of text formatting, color combinations, alignment, spacing, and punctuation enables simplicity and improves readability for the reader.

Formatting text uniformly by utilizing distinct design and structures such as that in headings, tables, lists, URLs, and code examples helps distinguish information easily, while also making it easier for scannable and accessible documentation.

## Text highlighting

Text can be highlighted to distinguish itself from other text using the following text-formatting conventions:  

**Bold**  
Use bold formatting, `<b>` in HTML or `**` in Markdown for [UI elements]() and at the beginning of [notices]().

Although a double underscore (`__`) can be used for bold formatting in Markdown, it can be difficult to distinguish in a text editor. Preferably, use double asterisks (`**`) for bold formatting in Markdown.  

**Italic**  

Use italic formatting, `<i>` in HTML or `_` in Markdown, when drawing attention to a specific word or phrase, such as when defining or introducing [key terms]() or using [words as words](). You can also use a single asterisk (`**`) for italic formatting in Markdown.  

**Underline**  

Do not underline.

**Strikethrough**  

Do not strikethrough.

**Code text**  

Use `<code>` in HTML or ``` ` ``` in Markdown to apply a monospace font and other styling to [code in text](), inline code, and user input.

Use `<pre>` in HTML or ` ``` ` in Markdown for [code samples]() or other blocks of code.

Do not override or modify font styles inline.



## Using type

Clear, legible, as well as aesthetically pleasing typography is one of the primary features in visually appealing content.

- In general, use sentence-case capitalization and avoid other forms of capitalization such as all-uppercase, all-lowercase, or title case.
  For more information, see [Capitalization]().
- Use left alignment for text. This ensures an even left margin with a irregular right margin- improving document structure.
- Avoid center-aligned text.
- Ensure adequate and consistent line spacing - which is the amount of vertical space between two lines of text in a text body. If your site's design determines the line spacing, don't change it. Don't reduce line spacing to fit more text or content; rewrite or edit the text instead.

See [Capitalization](), [Headings](), [Procedures](), [Code examples](), and [UI elements]() for additional information.

### Formatting common text elements

| Text element | Convention | Example |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Code and console output | Use code text. Refer [Code text](). | `alt="The WordPress mascot Wapuu."` |  
| Company-, product-, brand-names, and trademarks | Title-style capitalization is generally used if there are two or more proper nouns. Refer [Trademarks](). | WordPress<br /><br />WordCamp Central  |
| Emphasis | Sometimes it's acceptable to use italic text for emphasis. | Use the 24-hour format only when *absolutely* needed. |
| Error messages | Use sentence-style capitalization. Enclose in quotation marks when referencing error messages in text. | Error Code 345. Do you want to continue? <br /> If you see the error message, "Executable not found." quit and restart the terminal. |
| Filename extensions | All lowercase. See also [Filenames]() | `.css`<br />`.php` |
| Filenames | All lowercase. Refer [Filenames](). | `new-cache.php`<br />`wp-settings-1.php` |
| Key terms | Italicize the first mention of a new term. Refer [Key terms](). | An administrator’s tool of sorts, *phpMyAdmin* is a PHP script meant for giving users the ability to interact with their MySQL databases. |

## Spaces between sentences

Leave only one space between sentences; that is, leave only one space between the sentence-ending punctuation and the first character of the next sentence.
