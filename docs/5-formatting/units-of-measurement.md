# Units of Measurement

## Spaces in units of measurement

Insert a nonbreaking space between the number and a unit for most units of measurement. Refer [Abbreviations]() for more information on when to spell out units.

## Ranges of numbers with units


## Rates


## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies. Use [ISO defined country or region codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

See [Currency in Numbers]() for additional information.

## Using abbreviations to denote numbers

In general, don't abbreviate *thousand, million*, and *billion* as *K, M*, and *B* or *K, mn* and *bn*. For more information, see [Numbers - Abbreviations]().
