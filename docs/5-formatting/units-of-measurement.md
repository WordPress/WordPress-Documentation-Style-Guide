# Units of Measurement

## Spaces in units of measurement

Insert a nonbreaking space between the number and a unit for most units of measurement. Refer [Abbreviations]() for more information on when to spell out units.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 16ft [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: 16`&nbsp;`ft [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 75`&nbsp;`kg [/tip]  

Don't use a space when the unit of measure is a percentage, money, or degrees of an angle.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: 55% [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: $3000 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 130Â° [/tip]  

## Ranges of numbers with units


## Rates

Use the word *per* instead of the division slash (/) while indicating rates. It's acceptable to use the division slash where space is too limited.

Shorten *per* to *p* only for well-established abbreviations such as *Gbps* for *Gigabits per second*.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The server handles 90k transactions/hour. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The server handles 90k transactions per hour. [/tip]  

## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies. Use [ISO defined country or region codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

See [Currency in Numbers]() for additional information.

## Using abbreviations to denote numbers

In general, don't abbreviate *thousand, million*, and *billion* as *K, M*, and *B* or *K, mn* and *bn*. In some contexts, using the abbreviations may be more relevant or suited. If you use abbreviations, see [Numbers - Abbreviations]() for more information.
