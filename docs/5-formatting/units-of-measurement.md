# Units of measurement

## Spaces in units of measurement

Insert a nonbreaking space between the number and a unit for most units of measurement. Refer [Abbreviations]() for more information on when to spell out units.

**Examples**  

[warning] ****Not recommended:**** 16ft [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 16`&nbsp;`ft [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 75`&nbsp;`kg [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 10`&nbsp;`GB [/tip]  

Don't use a space when the unit of measure is a percentage, money, or degrees of an angle.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:** 55% [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** $3000 [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 130° [/tip]  

## Ranges of numbers with units

For a range of numbers that have units, repeat the unit for each number in the range. Units include abbreviations (such as *GB* for *Gigabytes*) and symbols (such as the degree symbol (°)), but not nouns like *file*.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** -10-33 °C  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** -10 °C to 33 °C [/tip]  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The recommended file size is 50 - 100 MB. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The recommended file size is 50 MB to 100 MB. [/tip]  

For more information, see [En dashes](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/dashes/#en-dashes), [Range of numbers](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/numbers/#range-of-numbers), and [Numbers and fractions](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/hyphens/#numbers-and-fractions).

## Rates

Use the word *per* instead of the division slash (/) while indicating rates. It's acceptable to use the division slash where space is too limited.

Shorten *per* to *p* only for well-established abbreviations such as *Gbps* for *Gigabits per second*.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The server handles 90k transactions/hour. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The server handles 90k transactions per hour. [/tip]  

## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies. Use [ISO defined country or region codes](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

See [Currency in Numbers]() for additional information.

## Using abbreviations to denote numbers

In general, don't abbreviate *thousand, million*, and *billion* as *K, M*, and *B* or *K, mn* and *bn*. In some contexts, using the abbreviations may be more relevant or suited. If you use abbreviations, see [Numbers - Abbreviations]() for more information.
