# Units of measurement

[info] **Highlight:** Insert a nonbreaking space between the number and a unit of measurement. [/info]  

## Spaces in units of measurement

Insert a nonbreaking space between the number and a unit for most units of measurement. For more information about when to spell out units, see [Abbreviations](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/language-grammar/abbreviations/#spelling-out-and-declaring-abbreviations).

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** 16ft [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 16`&nbsp;`ft [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 75`&nbsp;`kg [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 10`&nbsp;`GB [/tip]  

Don't use a space when the unit of measure is a percentage, money, or degrees of an angle.

**Examples**  
[tip] **Recommended:** 55% [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** $3000 [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** 130° [/tip]  

## Ranges of numbers with units

For a range of numbers that have units, repeat the unit for each number in the range. Units include abbreviations (such as *GB* for *Gigabytes*) and symbols (such as the degree symbol (°)), but not nouns like *file*.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** -10-33 °C  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** -10 °C to 33 °C [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** The recommended file size is 50 - 100 MB. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The recommended file size is 50 MB to 100 MB. [/tip]  

For more information, see [En dashes](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/dashes/#en-dashes), [Ranges of numbers](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/numbers/#ranges-of-numbers), and [Numbers and fractions](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/hyphens/#numbers-and-fractions).

## Rates

Use the word *per* instead of the division slash (/) while indicating rates. It's acceptable to use the division slash where space is too limited.

Shorten *per* to *p* only for well-established abbreviations such as *Gbps* for *Gigabits per second*.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** The server handles 90k transactions/hour. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The server handles 90k transactions per hour. [/tip]  

## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies. Use [ISO defined country or region codes](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

For more information, see [Currency](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/numbers/#currency).

## Using abbreviations to denote numbers

In general, don't abbreviate *thousand, million*, and *billion* as *K, M*, and *B* or *K, mn* and *bn*. In some contexts, using the abbreviations may be more relevant or suited. If you use abbreviations, see [Abbreviations in numbers](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/numbers/#abbreviations) for more information.
