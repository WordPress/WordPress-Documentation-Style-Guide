# Trademarks

For trademark marking or attribution in documentation, follow the trademark, licensing, and citation guidelines provided by the owners of the respective marks.

## Using trademarks

Always use trademarked terms as adjectives. Don't use trademarked terms in verb or noun forms.

## Possessive forms of trademarks

In general, avoid forming possessives of company, product or brand names, regardless of who owns the name.
