## Using trademarks

Always use trademarked terms as adjectives. Don't use trademarked terms in verb or noun forms. If a trademark is more than one word, don’t break it across multiple lines of text; instead, use a nonbreaking space in between.

## Plural forms of trademarks

In general, avoid forming plural forms of company, product, or brand names, regardless of who owns the name.

## Possessive forms of trademarks
