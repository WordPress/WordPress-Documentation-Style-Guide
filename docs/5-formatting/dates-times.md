# Dates and times

In general, spell out months and days whenever possible. Use the *Day of week, month dd, year* date format. For example, use *Sunday, August 16, 2020*. Express time in the 12-hour format, capitalize AM and PM, and include the time zone.

Expressing dates and times in a clearly defined manner reduces confusion and improves translation support for a [global audience](/2-document-guidelines/4-global-audience.md).
