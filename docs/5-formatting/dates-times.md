# Dates and times

In general, spell out months and days whenever possible. Use the *Day of week, month dd, year* date format. For example, use *Sunday, August 16, 2020*. Express time in the 12-hour format, capitalize AM and PM, and include the time zone.

Expressing dates and times in a clearly defined manner reduces confusion and improves translation support for a [global audience](/2-document-guidelines/4-global-audience.md).

## Expressing times

Use the following guidelines to express time:
- Express time in the 12-hour format. Use the 24-hour format only when absolutely needed. If a particular UI, statement or code example uses the 24-hour format, then use that format throughout the page for consistency. [review]
- Use numerals to express times of the day.
- Always include *AM* and *PM*. Insert a space between the time and *AM* or *PM* and ensure that it is capitalized.  
  **Examples**  

  [tip] Recommended: 4:32 PM, 12:00 PM, 7:15 AM. [/tip]  

- For time ranges, use the word *to* instead of the en dash. Use an en dash with no surrounding spaces for a schedule or listing.  
  **Examples**  

  [tip] Recommended: The server was down from 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM. [/tip]  
  [tip] Recommended: The meeting is scheduled from 15:00–16:00 UTC. [/tip]  

  **Exception:** For date ranges consisting of two dates and times, use an en dash with spaces surrounding the dash.  
  **Examples**  

  [tip] Recommended: 7:30 AM–9:15 AM 05/11/2020 (time range on a single day) [/tip]  
  [tip] Recommended: 7:30 AM 04/11/2020 – 9:15 AM 05/11/2020 (date and time range) [/tip]  
- It is acceptable to remove the minutes from round hours.  
  **Examples**  

  [tip] Recommended: 4 PM. [/tip]  
- Use *noon* and *midnight* but not when paired with time in the numeral format.
  **Examples**  

  [warning] Not Recommended: *12:00 noon, 12:00 midnight*.  [/warning]
