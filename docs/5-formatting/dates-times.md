# Dates and times

In general, spell out months and days whenever possible. Use the *Day of week, month dd, year* date format. For example, use *Sunday, August 16, 2020*. Express time in the 12-hour format, capitalize AM and PM, and include the time zone.

Expressing dates and times in a clearly defined manner reduces confusion and improves translation support for a [global audience](/2-document-guidelines/4-global-audience.md).

## Expressing times

Use the following guidelines to express time:
- Express time in the 12-hour format. Use the 24-hour format only when absolutely needed. If a particular UI, statement or code example uses the 24-hour format, then use that format throughout the page for consistency. [review]
- Use numerals to express times of the day.
- Always include *AM* and *PM*. Insert a space between the time and *AM* and *PM* and ensure that it is capitalized.
