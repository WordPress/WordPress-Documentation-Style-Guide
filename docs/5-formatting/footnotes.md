## Footnotes

Avoid writing footnotes in documentation.

A footnote is an annotation provided at the end of a paragraph, chapter, or a page with additional information related to the content.
Rather than using a footnote, you can use a [note](), [link](), use [parentheses](), or [dashes]().

If there is no alternative than using a footnote, then use a symbol instead of a number. Use the symbols: *, †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶ - preferably in that order. [review https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_(typography)#Numbering_and_symbols]
