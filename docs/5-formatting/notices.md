# Notices

[info] **Highlight:** Use notices to warn, alert, notify, or provide useful information to readers. [/info]  

## Cautions, warnings, notes, and other notices

To warn, alert, notify, or provide useful information to the reader that isn't part of the flow of text or needs to be highlighted, use one of the following notice types:

- **Note** or **Info**  
  Use this notice type for an informational note or message with the `[ info ][ /info ]` (without spaces) short code.   

  **Example**  
  [info] **Note:** “Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the theme of your site. [/info]  

- **Tip**  
  Use this notice type to highlight tips and recommended actions with the `[ tip ][ /tip ]` (without spaces) short code.  

  **Example**  
  [tip] **Tip:** You can use the slash command to insert a new block. [/tip]  

- **Caution** or **Alert**  
  Use this notice type to suggest readers to proceed with caution and alert them to important messages with the `[ alert ][ /alert ]` (without spaces) short code.

  **Example**  
  [alert] **Caution:** Using a deprecated version may cause different outcomes. [/alert]  

- **Warning**  
  When something is particularly precarious use this notice type with the `[ warning ][ /warning ]` (without spaces) short code. A warning is generally stricter and more rigid than a caution.

  **Example**  
  [warning] **Warning:** Making changes to the code while running the server could cause errors in your databases; specifically, corrupted tables or duplicate values. [/warning]  

- **Tutorial** or **Step**  
  Use this notice type to indicate a step or procedure in a tutorial with the `[ tutorial ][ /tutorial ]` (without spaces) short code.  

  **Example**  
  [tutorial] **Step:** Move the selected file to this folder. [/tutorial]  

Avoid grouping two or more notices together. Consider rewriting or rearranging the content to avoid confusion.

## Other formatting style for notices

If your website or page uses a different standardized formatting style for notices, you can supersede the aforementioned formatting style.
