# Cautions, warnings, notes, and other notices

To warn, alert, notify, or provide useful information to the reader that isn't part of the flow of text or needs to be highlighted, use one of the following notice types:

- **Note** or **Info**   
  Use this notice type for an informational note or message with the `[info][/info]` short code.

  **Example**  

  [info]  [/info]  

- **Tip**  
  Use this notice type to highlight tips and recommended actions with the `[tip][/tip]` short code.

  **Example**  

  [tip] [/tip]  

- **Caution** or **Alert**  
  Use this notice type to suggest readers to proceed with caution and alert them to important messages with the `[alert][/alert]` short code.

  **Example**  

  [alert] [/alert]  

- **Warning**  
  When something is particularly precarious use this notice type with the `[warning][/warning]` short code. A warning is generally stricter and more rigid than a caution.

  **Example**  

  [warning] [/warning]
