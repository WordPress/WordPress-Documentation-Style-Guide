  [tip] Recommended: The folder contains 3 of the 256-bit AES encrypted files. [/tip]

## Ordinal numbers

Write all ordinal numbers as fully-spelled words.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 18th, 99th [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: First, second, third, seventh, eighteenth, ninety-ninth [/tip]  

## Numbers as Roman numerals

Avoid using Roman numerals. Instead use standard Arabic numerals in your documentation.

You can use Roman numerals to denote "steps or sub-steps in procedures."

## Commas and decimal points in numbers

Use commas and decimal points as per American number formatting. Use commas in numbers having four or more digits, setting off groups of three digits left of the decimal point. Don't use spaces, commas, or any separators to the right of the decimal point.

Use a period to denote a decimal point.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: You can carry out a maximum of 1500000 transactions per month. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: You can carry out a maximum of 1,500,000 transactions per month. [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17000. [/warning]  
[warning] Not Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17 000. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17,000. [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: Your account will be credited 0.079 635 credits every two hours. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Your account will be credited 0.079635 credits every two hours. [/tip]  


## Fractions

Express fractions as decimal numbers whenever possible, but expressing them as words or symbols as is acceptable as well. Don't use slashes with fractions, as they may be difficult to comprehend. Using slashes with fractions could be misunderstood as alternatives or combinations. When expressing fractions as words, use a hyphen to link the numerator with the denominator, unless one of them is already hyphenated.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 3/4 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: ¾ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 0.75 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 75% [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: three-fourths [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: 4 1/2 [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: 4½ [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 4.5 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: four one-halves [/tip]  

## Percentages

Denote percentages with the numeral and a percent sign (%) after it, without a space between them.  
**Exception:** If the percentage starts the sentence, then spell out both the number and the word *percent*.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: 99 percent completed. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: The progress bar is at 99%. [/tip]  

## Currency

Mention to the reader distinctly what country's currency that you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign ($) can be mistaken for US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and multiple other currencies. Use [ISO defined country or region codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) to depict international currencies, if possible.

When you're referencing specific amounts of money, use the currency code, followed by the amount, with no space.

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended: The non-profit organization was endowed with a USD1.5 million grant.  [/tip]  

Capitalize the country or region, but lowercase the name of currencies.

**Examples**  

- US dollar
- Indian rupee
- Japanese yen

For US dollars, use the dollar sign at the beginning ($) of the currency. Use a comma to delineate the thousands place of whole currency; that is, use a comma in amounts that have four or more digits. Use a period to delineate whole currency and fractions of currency. Don't use any punctuation or spaces to the right of the decimal.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: You have $15.39,512 in usable credits. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: You have $15.39512 in usable credits. [/tip]  

[tip] Recommended: Monthly hosting plans start from $3.95 per website. [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17000. [/warning]  
[warning] Not Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17 000. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The total cost may exceed $17,000. [/tip]  

If it's clear which currency you're referring to, it's acceptable to only use the symbol rather than the word or country code itself.

## Dimensions

Use numerals for dimensions.

Use a lowercase *x* between the numerals in the dimensions, with no space between the numerals and the *x*. You can also use the multiplication sign (×). Use a space before and after the multiplication sign.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: 144 x 144 px  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: 144x144 pixels [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 50-foot fiber optic cable [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: 3840x2160 [/tip]  

## Exponents

Write exponents using [standard mathematical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation) *b<sup>n</sup>*, where the base is *b* and the exponent or power is *n*.

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended: 3<sup>4</sup> [/tip]  

## Range of numbers

[En dashes]() are generally used to indicate a range of numbers, the minus sign, or negative numbers. Although you can use en dashes for these purposes, you can also use hyphens or the word *to* for numerical ranges.

Use an en dash indicate a range of numbers such as values or dates. Don't add spaces before and after the en dash or the hyphen.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012 – 2017.  [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The program was under active development from 2012–2017. [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: Select a range from 10–60 px as the width of the button. [/tip]  

For additional information, see [En dashes](), [Hyphens](), and [Units of Measurement]().

## Suspended hyphens

Use [suspended hyphens]() for two or more suspended compound modifiers that start with numbers.

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended: You can choose from either a five-, six-, or seven-sided polygon. [/tip]
