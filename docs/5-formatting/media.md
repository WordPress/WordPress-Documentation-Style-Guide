# Media

## Images, illustrations, and graphics

Use images only when they provide visual information that is otherwise difficult to express with words, examples, or other methods.

### General guidelines for images

- Don't use images of text, examples, code snippets, or other media solely comprised of text.
- Don't include personally identifying information (PII) in screenshots and other images.<br />
  If there is PII in a screenshot, redact it with a solid color with 100% opacity. Don't use blurs, pixelation, mosaic effects, or similar image-processing effects to redact PII, as such effects can be reversed to reveal the original information.
