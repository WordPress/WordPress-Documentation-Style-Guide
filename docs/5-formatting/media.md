# Media

## Images, illustrations, and graphics

Use images only when they provide visual information that is otherwise difficult to express with words, examples, or other methods.

### General guidelines for images

- Don't use images of text, examples, code snippets, or other media solely comprised of text.
- Include screenshots with a full window; include the window's title bar in the screenshot.
- Maintain consistency of the operating system (OS) in screenshots - don't use a Linux OS in one and macOS in the other.
- Don't include personally identifying information (PII) in screenshots and other images.
  - If there is PII in a screenshot, redact it with a solid color with 100% opacity. Don't use blurs, pixelation, mosaic effects, or similar image-processing effects to redact PII, as these effects can be reversed to reveal the original information.
  - If you're exporting an image to a format that can include information on separate layers (for example, PDF or TIFF), flatten the image on export.
