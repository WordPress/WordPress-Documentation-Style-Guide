# Media

## Images, illustrations, and graphics

Use images only when they provide visual information that is otherwise difficult to express with words, examples, or other methods.

### General guidelines for images

- Don't use images of text, examples, code snippets, or other media solely comprised of text.
- Include screenshots with a full window; include the window's title bar in the screenshot.
- Maintain consistency of the operating system (OS) in screenshots - don't use a Linux OS in one and macOS in the other.
- Don't include personally identifying information (PII) in screenshots and other images.
  - If there is PII in a screenshot, redact it with a solid color with 100% opacity. Don't use blurs, pixelation, mosaic effects, or similar image-processing effects to redact PII, as these effects can be reversed to reveal the original information.
  - If you're exporting an image to a format that can include information on separate layers (for example, PDF or TIFF), flatten the image on export.
- Use drawing tools to create diagrams.
- For diagrams (such as network flows, system architectures) use vector graphic formats like SVG. SVG files stay sharp when you zoom in on the image. If you don't have an SVG image, use a PNG image as it provides better image quality than other raster image formats.
- Don't use image maps as they prove to be difficult for accessibility. Image maps are also problematic for a responsive design implementation that adapts to different viewport sizes, while also being complex. Instead, write a list of text references following the image.

### Text associated with images

In most cases, introduce an image with an introductory sentence that initiates the image that follows. If the heading of the content explains what the image is about, and no additional context is required, then don't include an introductory statement. You can introduce a image with an imperative statement.

The introductory sentence can end with a colon or a period. Use a period if the introductory content is extended, and a colon if the introductory statement is shorter and immediately precedes the image. The text preceding the colon must distinctly stand alone as a complete sentence. That is, don't introduce a image with a partial statement.

There are different types of text associated with images. Alt text is a concise description of the image that can replace the image in situations when the image isn't visible as well as accessible documentation. For example, people using screen readers, people using text-only browsers or people having a low-bandwidth internet connection can benefit from alt text. Alt text should consider the context of the image, not just its content. For more information, see [alt attribute](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute).

An image caption is a short description of the image. An image description is a textual explanation of the image which can be used to convey detailed descriptions than image captions.

Captions are brief, concise summaries of an image or a figure.
