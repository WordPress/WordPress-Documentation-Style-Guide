# Tables

Tables are useful to present lengthy and complex pieces of data that are related, in a well-structured format that is easy to read and scan for readers.

## Choosing between a list or table

Sometimes to represent data, it could be confusing as to what would be ideal - a list or a table. Refer the following table to select between a list or a table:

| Item type | Example | List or table |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Each item is a single unit. | A procedure with instructions. | Use a [bulleted list](), [numbered list](), or [lettered list](). |
| Each item consists of a two related pieces of data. | A glossary with term and description pairs. | Use a [description list](). |
| Each item consists of three or more related pieces of data. | A set of parameters with multiple values, data, categories, and descriptions. | Use a table. |
