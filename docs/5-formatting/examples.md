# Examples and scenarios

Providing examples in documentation helps the reader visualize concepts. Be thoughtful while writing and coming up with fictitious examples and scenarios; sometimes they may be unintentionally biased. As well as writing diverse and inclusive documentation, don't reveal personally identifiable information such as real names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or financial information.

## Example domain names
