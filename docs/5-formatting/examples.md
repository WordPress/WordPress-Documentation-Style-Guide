# Examples and scenarios

Providing examples in documentation helps the reader visualize concepts. Be thoughtful while writing and coming up with fictitious examples and scenarios; sometimes they may be unintentionally biased. As well as writing diverse and inclusive documentation, don't reveal personally identifiable information such as real names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or financial information. In addition to fictitious examples and scenarios, you can also use [placeholder variables]() like *`EMAIL_ADDRESS`* or *`PHONE_NUMBER`*.

## Example domain names

While writing a generic domain name in an example, use example.com, example.org, or example.net.

## Example email addresses

For example email addresses, use one of the domains listed in [Example domain names](#example-domain-names).

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended: name@example.com [/tip]  

## Example person names


## Example organization names

When you need an organization name in an example, use *Example Organization*. If you need multiple organization names or need to differentiate between two fictional companies, add a description to the organization names. For example, you can use *Example Tech Organization* and *Example Education Organization*.  

## Example phone numbers

Don't use real phone numbers in examples.

For phone number examples according to the [North American Numbering Plan](//phone-numbers.md), use a US number in the range (800) 555-0100 through (800) 555-0199. That range is reserved for use in examples and in fiction.

For international phone number examples, use a US number from the same range and include the country and area codes. For additional information regarding phone number formatting, see [Phone numbers]().

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: (800) 555-0139 [/tip]  
[tip] Recommended: +1 800 555 0139 [/tip]  

## Example IP addresses

For IPv4 examples, use one of the [RFC 5737](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737) addresses reserved for documentation purposes. These addresses are not used on the internet. The three reserved IPv4 addresses are as follows:
- `192.0.2.1`
- `198.51.100.1`
- `203.0.113.1`

## Example street addresses
