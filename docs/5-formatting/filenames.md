# Filenames, file formats, and types

## Naming files

Use lowercase file, folder, and directory names. In general, separate words in filenames with hyphens, not underscores. Use standard [ASCII alphanumeric characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_set) in file, folder, and directory names.
