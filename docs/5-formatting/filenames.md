# Filenames, file formats, and types

## Naming files

Use lowercase file, folder, and directory names. In general, separate words in filenames with hyphens, not underscores. Use standard [ASCII alphanumeric characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_set) in file, folder, and directory names.

### Consistent naming

If you're creating and naming new files where other files have a different naming convention, see if the other files and folders can be renamed with the aforementioned guidelines. If you cannot change existing filenames, it is acceptable to use underscores or other naming conventions that are in use, to remain consistent with the existing style.

For example, if the directory already has files named as `theme_1.php`, `theme_2.php`, and `theme_3.php`, it's acceptable to name the new file as `theme_4.php` instead of `theme-4.php`.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: `newcache.php`, `newCache.php`, `new-cach√©.php` [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: `new-cache.php` [/tip]  
[tip] Sometimes okay: `new_cache.php` [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: `wpsettings1.php`, `wpSettings1.php`, `WPSettings1.php`, `wp-settings1.php`, `wpsettings-1.php` [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: `wp-settings-1.php` [/tip]  
[tip] Sometimes okay: `wp_settings_1.php` [/tip]  

It's acceptable to have some inconsistency in file and folder names if it can't be avoided otherwise. There might be predefined design and style guidelines or undocumented guidelines that are already in use. Sometimes, file naming can also be automated by the product. In those cases, it's okay to make exceptions for those files.

## Referring to files

### Referring to filenames

While referring to a file, follow these guidelines:

- Use [code font]().
- Use the exact name of the file, even if it doesn't follow the [file naming guidelines](#naming-files).
- If content from the file is included in the page, follow the [code sample]() guidelines and precede the code sample or content with an introductory statement that states the filename.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: In the following `styles.css` file, set the `opacity` to 0.75: [/tip]  

### File interactions

While writing about file interactions, don't use the file types as a verb.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: Unzip the file. [/warning]  
[warning] Not Recommended: Unzip the zip file. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Extract the zip file. [/tip]  

### Referring to file types

Use the formal file type instead of the file extension while referring to file types. Many file types are expressed in uppercase, as they are acronyms or initialisms.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: a `.css` file [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: a CSS file [/tip]  

[warning] Not Recommended: a `.py` file [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: a Python file [/tip]
