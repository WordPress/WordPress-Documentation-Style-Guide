# Filenames, file formats, and types

## Naming files

Use lowercase file, folder, and directory names. In general, separate words in filenames with hyphens, not underscores. Use standard [ASCII alphanumeric characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_set) in file, folder, and directory names.

### Consistent naming

If you're creating and naming new files where other files have a different naming convention, see if the other files and folders can be renamed with the aforementioned guidelines. If you cannot change existing filenames, it is acceptable to use underscores or other naming conventions that are in use, to remain consistent with the existing style.

For example, if the directory already has files named as `theme_1.php`, `theme_2.php`, and `theme_3.php`, it's acceptable to name the new file as `theme_4.php` instead of `theme-4.php`.
