# Lists

Lists are useful to present lengthy and complex content in a well structured format that is easy to read and scan for readers. Use a parallel syntax for all lists and its items.

For more information about procedural steps that provide instructions to achieve a particular task, see [Procedures]().

## Types of lists

### Bulleted lists

Use a bulleted list for items that don't need to appear in order or sequence and items that aren't options.

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended:  
With this theme, you can do the following:

### Numbered lists

Use a numbered list for sequential items in order (such as a sequence of steps) or prioritized items (such as a countdown list).

**Example**

### Lettered list

Use a lettered list to denote options to choose among. In many instances, a lettered list has mutually exclusive options.

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended:  
Select a theme to install:
A. Twenty Twenty-One
B. Twenty Twenty
C. Twenty Nineteen
D. Twenty Eighteen

### Description list

Use a description list for listing down items with their descriptions, definitions, or explanations. A description list is generally used to emphasize multiple items with their descriptions (such as a glossary).

**Example**  

[tip] Recommended:  

**Backlink**  
Incoming links to a web page.

**bbPress**  
Free, open-source software built on top of WordPress for easily creating forums on sites.

**CLI**  
Command Line Interface. Terminal (Bash) in Mac, Command Prompt in Windows, or WP-CLI for WordPress.

**DNS**  
Domain Name System – how you assign a human readable address to a website’s exact numeric coded location.

## Introductory sentences

In most cases, introduce a list with an introductory sentence that initiates the list that follows. If the heading of the content explains what the list is about, and no additional context is required, then don't include an introductory statement. You can introduce a list with an imperative statement.

The introductory sentence can end with a colon or a period. Use a period if the introductory content is extended, and a colon if the introductory statement is shorter and immediately precedes the list. The text preceding the colon must distinctly stand alone as a complete sentence. That is, don't introduce a list with a partial statement.

For information regarding punctuation and capitalization of lists, see [Capitalization and end punctuation]().
