# Lists

Lists are useful to present lengthy and complex content in a well structured format that is easy to read and scan for readers.

For more information about procedural steps that provide instructions to achieve a particular task, see [Procedures]().

## Types of lists

### Bulleted lists

Use a bulleted list for items that don't need to appear in order or sequence and items that aren't options.

**Example**
