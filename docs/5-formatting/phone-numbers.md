## Phone numbers in examples

Use mock phone numbers instead of real ones in examples. For additional information about what phone numbers to use in examples, see [Example phone numbers](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/examples/#example-phone-numbers).  

## Writing real phone numbers

If you're providing a real phone number to contact a real individual or organization, use the following formats to write them.

### North American phone numbers

To format phone numbers in the USA, Canada, and other [NANP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan) (North American Numbering Plan) countries, enclose the area code in parentheses, insert a space, and then hyphenate the three-digit exchange code with the four-digit number.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:** (800) 555-0139 [/tip]  

### International phone numbers

To format phone numbers in non-NANP countries, include the country and area codes at the beginning of the phone number. Insert a plus sigh before the country code without any space in between. The plus sign (+) stands in for a prefix known as an *exit code* that lets you dial out of a country. Separate the groups of numbers with spaces.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:** +1 800 555 0139 [/tip]
