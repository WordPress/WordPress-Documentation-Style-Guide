# Obsolete content

As WordPress develops and evolves systematically, some methods and technologies change, which may outdate documentation.

## Types of obsolete content

Obsolete content can be identified by the following types:  
- A whole page or article is outdated.
- A section from a page or article is outdated.
- A specific part of a section, page, or article is outdated.

## Marking content as obsolete

- Use the **Warning** [notice type]() to mark content as obsolete.
- Write a warning as follows: *__Warning:__ This content has been marked as outdated.*
- Use an **Info** notice type and add a URL of updated documentation, if any.
- Write the notice as follows: *__Note:__ This page was moved to <code><var>PAGE_URL</var></var>.* Replace <code><var>PAGE_URL</var></var> with the URL of the updated documentation.
