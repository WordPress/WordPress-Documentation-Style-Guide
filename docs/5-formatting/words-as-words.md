# Words as words

Italicize words used as words.

While referring to a particular word or phrase as the word or phrase itself, use italic formatting. For additional information about italics, see [Text highlighting](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/text/#text-highlighting).

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** Don't substitute a **/** (slash) as a conjunction. Use the word **or** instead. [/warning]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Don't substitute a "/" (slash) as a conjunction. Use the word "or" instead. [/warning]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Don't substitute a / (slash) as a conjunction. Use the word or instead. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Don't substitute a */* (slash) as a conjunction. Use the word *or* instead. [/tip]  

While referring to letters as letters, use italics.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** If a proper noun ends with an **s**, you can either use an apostrophe and **s** or just an apostrophe.  [/warning]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** If a proper noun ends with an "s", you can either use an apostrophe and "s" or just an apostrophe.  [/warning]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** If a proper noun ends with an s, you can either use an apostrophe and s or just an apostrophe.  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** If a proper noun ends with an *s*, you can either use an apostrophe and *s* or just an apostrophe.  [/tip]  

Use an apostrophe and an *s* to form the plural, but don’t italicize the apostrophe or the *s*.
