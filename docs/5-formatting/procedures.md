# Procedures and instructions

A procedure is a sequence of numbered steps or instructions for achieving a particular task. Procedures can be presented in various formats such as illustrations, infographics, videos, single-step instructions, and numbered procedures.

For more information about lists of items that aren't part of a procedure, see [Lists]().

## Introductory sentences

Introduce a procedure with an introductory sentence that initiates the following procedure. If the heading of the content explains what the procedure is, and no additional context is required, then don't include an introductory statement. You can introduce a procedure with an imperative statement.

The introductory sentence can end with a colon or a period. Use a period if the introductory content is extended, and a colon if the introductory statement is shorter and immediately precedes the procedure. The text preceding the colon must distinctly stand alone as a complete sentence. That is, don't introduce a procedure with a partial statement.
