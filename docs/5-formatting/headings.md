# Headings and titles

Headings provide proper content structure and visual points for readers to scan and navigate through content on any page. The heading hierarchy, along with other formatting such as spacing, lists, and illustrations helps break up long walls of text into a readable structure. It is also easier to jump between sections or pages if the headings and titles stand out.
