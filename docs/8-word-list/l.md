One word. Not *lower case*. Don't use *lowercase* as a verb. Don't use *lowercased*.

When using both *uppercase* and *lowercase* together as a noun or to modify a noun, spell out both words. Don't use a suspended hyphen (as in *upper- and lowercase*).

## lower left, lower right

Hyphenate as adjectives. Use instead of *bottom left* and *bottom right*.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:** The lower-left corner [/tip]  

In general, avoid using directional language such as *left, right, up, down* in instructions to locate UI elements or other content. Directional language proves to be difficult for accessibility or for localization. People with cognitive impairments, as well as people using assistive technologies such as screen-reading software and might have difficulty interpreting directional language. If a particular UI element or other content is difficult to convey, include a screenshot or illustration.
