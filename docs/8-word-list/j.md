## just

Avoid using. In most cases, *just* is a filler word that can be omitted without changing the meaning of a sentence.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The `wp_mail()` function just sends an email. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The `wp_mail()` function sends an email. [/tip]  

If your meaning is unclear without *just*, then use a more specific term such as *only, instead,* or *previously*, or rephrase or rewrite your language to be more specific.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:**  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:**  [/tip]  

It is acceptable to use *just* to describe an approach that is easier or simpler than another.

**Example**  

[tip] **Recommended:** To add a new block, click on the **Inserter** button, or just use the slash command. [/tip]
