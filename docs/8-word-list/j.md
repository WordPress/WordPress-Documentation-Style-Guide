## just

Avoid using. In most cases, *just* is a filler word that can be omitted without changing the meaning of a sentence.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** The `wp_mail()` function just sends an email. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The `wp_mail()` function sends an email. [/tip]  

If your meaning is unclear without *just*, then use a more specific term such as *only, instead,* or *previously*, or rephrase or rewrite your language to be more specific.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Drag the block just as you would drag to upload an image. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Drag the block in the same way that you would drag to upload an image. [/tip]  
[warning] **Not recommended:** Just the Network Admin has the ability to install themes, plugins, and edit user profiles in a WordPress multisite network. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Only the Network Admin has the ability to install themes, plugins, and edit user profiles in a WordPress multisite network. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The Network Admin has the ability to install themes, plugins, and edit user profiles in a WordPress multisite network. [/tip]  

It is acceptable to use *just* to describe an approach that is easier or simpler than another.

**Example**  
[tip] **Recommended:** To add a new block, click on the **Inserter** button, or just use the slash command. [/tip]  

## justify, justified

Don't use to refer to the alignment of text to the left or right margin. Instead, use *alignment*. Justified text is text that is aligned on both the right and the left margins. To describe alignment on one margin only, use *left-aligned* or *right-aligned*, not *left-justified* or *right-justified*.
