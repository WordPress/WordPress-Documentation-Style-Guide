# Symbols

## & (ampersand)

Don't use *&* instead of *and* in most cases. It is acceptable to use *&* when referencing UI elements that use *&*, in places with space constraints, such as tables and UI element labels.

The use of `&` in code is completely fine.

## <> (angle brackets)

Use *angle brackets* to describe the *<* and *>* symbols. Don’t use *angle brackets* when you mean *brackets* ([]).

Use *opening bracket* and *closing bracket* to distinguish between the left and right brackets.

See also [[] (brackets)](#brackets).

## * (asterisk)

OK to use in developer documentation and for a technical audience.

Don't use an asterisk instead of the multiplication sign, or while expressing dimensions. Instead use the multiplication sign.

For more information, see [Dimensions](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/numbers/#dimensions) and [Placeholders](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/developer-content/placeholders/).

## [] (brackets)

## º (degree symbol)

Use degree symbol to describe the *º* symbol.

It's OK to use *degree* or *degrees* instead of the degree symbol.

## # (number sign)

Not *number symbol*.

Always spell out *number* in *number sign*. Don't use *pound sign* or *number symbol*.

**Examples**

Don't use the number sign preceding a numeral. Instead, spell out *number*. It's acceptable to abbreviate *number* as *no.*, but consider a global audience; as many languages don't abbreviate *number* as *no.* which may cause confusion.

It's OK to use the *#* symbol to indicate a hashtag. Don't use *number sign* to refer to the hashtag.
