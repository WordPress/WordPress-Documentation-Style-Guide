# Symbols

[alert] **Caution:** This page is currently under development. [/alert]  

## & (ampersand)

Don't use *&* instead of *and* in most cases. It is acceptable to use *&* when referencing UI elements that use *&*, in places with space constraints, such as tables and UI element labels.

The use of `&` in code is completely fine.

## º (degree sign)




## = (equal sign)

Not *equal’s sign, equals sign*, or *equal symbol*.

Insert a space before and after the equal sign.

## .htaccess

Use code font.

For more information, see [Filenames](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/filenames/).

## - (minus sign)



## × (multiplication sign)



## # (number sign)

Always spell out *number* in *number sign*. Don't use *pound sign* or *number symbol*.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** #99 [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** number 99 [/tip]  

Don't use the number sign preceding a numeral. Instead, spell out *number*. It's acceptable to abbreviate *number* as *no.*, but consider a global audience; as many languages don't abbreviate *number* as *no.* which may cause confusion.

It's OK to use the *#* symbol to indicate a hashtag. Don't use *number sign* to refer to the hashtag.
