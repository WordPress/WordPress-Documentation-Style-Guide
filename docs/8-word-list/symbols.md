# Symbols

[alert] **Caution:** This page is currently under development. [/alert]  

## & (ampersand)

Don't use *&* instead of *and* in most cases. It is acceptable to use *&* when referencing UI elements that use *&*, in places with space constraints, such as tables and UI element labels.

The use of `&` in code is completely fine.

## <> (angle brackets)

Use *angle brackets* to describe the *<* and *>* symbols. Don’t use *angle brackets* when you mean *brackets* ([]).

Use *opening bracket* and *closing bracket* to distinguish between the left and right brackets.

See also [[] (brackets)](#brackets).

## * (asterisk)

OK to use in developer documentation and for a technical audience.

Don't use an asterisk instead of the multiplication sign, or while expressing dimensions. Instead use the multiplication sign.

For more information, see [Dimensions](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/formatting/numbers/#dimensions) and [Placeholders](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/developer-content/placeholders/).

Use *opening braces* and *closing braces* to distinguish between the left and right braces.

## [] (brackets)

Use *brackets* to describe the *[* and *]* symbols. Don’t use *brackets* when you mean *angle brackets* (<>).

Use *opening bracket* and *closing brackets* to distinguish between the left and right brackets.

See also [<> (angle brackets)](#angle-brackets).

## º (degree symbol)

Use degree symbol to describe the *º* symbol.

It's OK to use *degree* or *degrees* instead of the degree symbol.

Use an en dash to indicate the minus sign. While writing an equation with a minus sign, insert a space before and after the minus sign (en dash).

## # (number sign)

Not *number symbol*.

**Examples**

Don't use the number sign preceding a numeral. Instead, spell out *number*. It's acceptable to abbreviate *number* as *no.*, but consider a global audience; as many languages don't abbreviate *number* as *no.* which may cause confusion.

It's OK to use the *#* symbol to indicate a hashtag. Don't use *number sign* to refer to the hashtag.
