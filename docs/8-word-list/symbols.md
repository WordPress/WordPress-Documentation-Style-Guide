# Symbols

[alert] **Caution:** This page is currently under development. [/alert]  

## & (ampersand)

Don't use *&* instead of *and* in most cases. It is acceptable to use *&* when referencing UI elements that use *&*, in places with space constraints, such as tables and UI element labels.

The use of `&` in code is completely fine.

## <> (angle brackets)

Use *angle brackets* to describe the *<* and *>* symbols. Don’t use *angle brackets* when you mean *brackets* ([]).

Use *opening bracket* and *closing bracket* to distinguish between the left and right brackets.

See also [[] (brackets)](#brackets).

## * (asterisk)
## @ (at sign)
## {} (braces)

Use *braces* to describe the *{}* symbols. Don't use *braces*.

Use *opening braces* and *closing braces* to distinguish between the left and right braces.

## [] (brackets)

Use *brackets* to describe the *[* and *]* symbols. Don’t use *brackets* when you mean *angle brackets* (<>).

Use *opening bracket* and *closing brackets* to distinguish between the left and right brackets.

See also [<> (angle brackets)](#angle-brackets).

## º (degree symbol)

## ÷ (division sign)

## = (equal sign)

Not *equal’s sign, equals sign*, or *equal symbol*.

Insert a space before and after the equal sign.

## .htaccess

Use code font.

## - (minus sign)



## × (multiplication sign)



## # (number sign)

Always spell out *number* in *number sign*. Don't use *pound sign* or *number symbol*.

**Examples**  
[warning] **Not recommended:** #99 [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** number 99 [/tip]  

Don't use the number sign preceding a numeral. Instead, spell out *number*. It's acceptable to abbreviate *number* as *no.*, but consider a global audience; as many languages don't abbreviate *number* as *no.* which may cause confusion.

It's OK to use the *#* symbol to indicate a hashtag. Don't use *number sign* to refer to the hashtag.

## + (plus sign)
