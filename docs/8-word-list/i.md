For more information about writing for a global audience, see [What is internationalization, localization, and translation?](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/general-guidelines/global-audience/#what-is-internationalization-localization-and-translation).

## icon

Use only to describe a graphic that represents another item or object such as a folder, document, or app.

Use bold formatting for the icon name. For more information, see [UI elements and interaction](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/developer-content/ui-elements/).

Don't use *icon* to describe options that appear on toolbars, menus, or other UI elements in a window. For options that have graphics rather than text labels, use the most descriptive term available, such as *button, box*, or *checkbox*.

If a graphic is enclosed in a rectangular border, then refer to it as a *button*. If it is not enclosed in a rectangular border, and doesn't initiate an action when clicked, then refer to it as an *icon*.

If an icon doesn't have any label or name, and you have to use a descriptor, use a contextually relevant term. Describe the icon's appearance or function and include an inline graphic of the icon. Don't enclose the icon in parentheses. Use lowercase. It's OK to use the word *icon* in discussions about the icon itself.
