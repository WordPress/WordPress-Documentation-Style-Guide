# U

## UI

Initialism for User Interface. Use uppercase.

Don't use *UI* to generically refer to UI elements. Instead, use the specific UI element term.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** In the **Link** UI, enter your sitemap link. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** In the **Link** box, enter your sitemap link.  [/tip]

## un-

In general, don't hyphenate words beginning with *un-* such as *unable* and *undo*, unless absolutely necessary, to avoid confusion. For example, hyphenate in cases such as *un-fitting*, or where *un-* is followed by a proper noun such as *un-American*.

For more information about hyphenation, see [Hyphens]().

## unavailable

Use to describe a UI element such as a menu item, dropdown list option, or button that the user can't interact with due to certain conditions. Also, use *unavailable* to describe unavailability of a product or service.

In general, describe how the user should interact with the UI rather than describing the state of the UI. Use *appears dimmed* for describing their appearance. Also include how the user can enable it and interact with the element.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:** If the editor permissions are unavailable, contact your site administrator. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The **Update** button is unavailable unless you change the post contents. [/tip]

## uncheck

Don't use to refer to the action of clearing a check mark from a checkbox. Instead, use *clear* for checkboxes, and *deselect* for other UI elements.

[warning] **Not recommended:** Deselect the **Crop thumbnail** checkbox. [/warning]
