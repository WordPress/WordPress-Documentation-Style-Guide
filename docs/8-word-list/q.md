# Q

## quality

Don't use *quality* by itself as an adjective. Instead, use a modifier and hyphenate. For example, *high-quality, studio-quality*.

## quick, quickly

Avoid using. *Quick* or *quickly* is a relative term, and in most cases, you can express the same meaning of a sentence without using these terms.

## quit

Don't use to refer to the action of closing a program, window, or a connection. Instead use *close, stop*, or *end*.

## quotation marks

Not *quotes* or *quote marks*. *Quote* is a verb, and *quotation* is an adjective or a noun.

## quote

Don't use *quote* to refer to cited content. Instead, use *quotation*.
