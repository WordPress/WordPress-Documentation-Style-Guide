## General guidelines for code examples

- Use spaces to indent code. Don't use tabs.
- Follow the indentation standards in the relevant [coding standards guideline]().
- Wrap lines after 80 characters.
- Mark code blocks as preformatted text. In HTML, use a `<pre>` element; in Markdown, indent every line of the code block by four spaces.
