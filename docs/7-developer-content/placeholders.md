# Placeholders

Placeholders in code and commands represent values that the user must input or replace. Placeholders in outputs can also represent values that differ. Generally, placeholders have a descriptive name and a value.

This page explains how to format placeholder variables in commands and code examples. For more information about other code-related documentation, see [Code in text](), [Code examples](), and [Command line interface syntax]().
