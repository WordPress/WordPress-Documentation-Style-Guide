# Placeholders

Placeholders in code and commands represent values that the user must input or replace. Placeholders in outputs can also represent values that differ. Generally, placeholders have a descriptive name and a value.

For example, *`POST_ID`* represents a post ID in a code example, command, and example output. In example output, *`VERSION`* represents the version of a plugin, theme, or software; the reader is not expected to set this to a specific value.

This page explains how to format placeholder variables in commands and code examples. For more information about other code-related documentation, see [Code in text](), [Code examples](), and [Command line interface syntax]().
