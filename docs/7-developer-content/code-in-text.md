# Code in text

In text content, use monospace code font to highlight and distinguish code content from standard text. To use code font in HTML, use the `<code>` element. In Markdown, use backticks (``` ` ```) for code font.

This page explains about formatting code in standard text sentences. For more information on other code-related documentation, see [Code samples](), [Placeholders](), and [Command line interface syntax]().
