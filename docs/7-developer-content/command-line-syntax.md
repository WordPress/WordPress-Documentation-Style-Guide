# Command-line syntax

This page explains how to format commands and their arguments in documentation. For more information about other code-related documentation, see [Code in text](), [Placeholders](), and [Code examples]().

## Command prompt

When you have to show multiple lines of command-line input, initiate each line with the dollar (`$`) prompt symbol.

**Examples**  

[tip] **Recommended:**  
```shell
$ wp theme activate twentytwentyone
```
The output is the following:

```
Success: Switched to 'Twenty Twenty-One' theme.
```
[/tip]
