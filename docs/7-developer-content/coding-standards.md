# Coding standards

WordPress is a big project with thousands of contributors. Itâ€™s important that best practices are followed so that the codebase is consistent and readable, and changes are easy to find and read, whether the code is five days old or five years old. WordPress coding standards are a series of best practices to help keep WordPress code clean and well documented for years to come.

The purpose of WordPress coding standards is to create a baseline for collaboration and review within various aspects of the WordPress open source project and community, from core code to themes to plugins.
