# UI elements and interaction

## Emphasize the task

When writing about interactions involving the user interface (UI), emphasize on the task to be accomplished, rather than how the user should interact with the UI element. By avoiding reference to UI elements, you help the reader understand the purpose of an instruction and avoid confusion due to additional external elements.

However, be watchful of the context and the reader demographic and how that influences your documentation; sometimes the objective of a procedure is to guide readers through elements on a page.
