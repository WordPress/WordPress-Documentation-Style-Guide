# Articles (a, an, the)

Articles modify nouns. *The* is a definite article, and is used to define specific or particular nouns.
*A* and *an* are indefinite articles, and are used to define non-specific or non-particular nouns.

For example, 'I watched *the* video.' Here, *the* particular video is being watched.
'I watched *a* video.' Here, it may be any video that is being watched.

Including articles in your writing is essential for overall simplicity of language and ease of understanding.

**Examples of articles**  

- A document
- An hour
- A link
- A project
- An open source project
- An issue
- A new issue

Using *a* or *an* depends on the pronunciation of the succeeding word. Basically, *a* is used before any consonant sound, and *an* is used before any vowel sound.
The article (*a* or *an*) that goes along with an abbreviation depends on whether the term is pronounced like an acronym or an initialism. For example, *an* API, *an* IDE, *a* URL, *a* CMS are the articles that go with these terms. For more information, see [Abbreviations]().
