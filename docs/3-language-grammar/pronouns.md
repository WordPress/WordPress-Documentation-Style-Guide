# Pronouns

A pronoun is a word that is used as a substitute for a noun or a noun phrase, which are contextually understood. Pronouns are used so that a particular noun isn't repeatedly used.

## Personal pronouns

Avoid using personal pronouns such as *I, we, us, our,* and *ours* except in the following contexts:  
- Questions in FAQs.
- A document whose author makes comments in the first person.
- Using *we* to refer your organization or team, after using its name for the first time.

Use second person (*you*) instead of first-person pronouns.

## Pronouns and genders

Don't use gender-specific pronouns unless the person being referred actually uses that gender. If you're unsure which gender-specific pronoun to use, rewrite the sentence using second person (*you*).

Use gender-neutral pronouns while particularly avoiding binary pronouns such as *he, him, she, her,* or renditions like *s/he, he/she,* or *(s)he*.
Instead, use *they* as a gender-neutral pronoun.

First try to rewrite the sentence—for example, by using the plural form, omitting the pronoun, replacing the pronoun with an article, or repeating the noun.

**Examples**

[warning] **Not recommended:** Contact the administrator using his or her email address. [/warning]
[tip] **Recommended (Using the plural form):** Contact the administrator using their email address. [/tip]
[tip] **Recommended (Omitting the pronoun):** Contact the administrator by email address. [/tip]
[tip] **Recommended (Replacing pronoun with article):** Contact the administrator using an email address. [/tip]
[tip] **Recommended (Repeating the noun):** Contact the administrator using the administrator's email address. [/tip]

If revising a sentence isn’t feasible, use *they, their,* or *them* as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun.

Whether used as singular or plural, *they* always takes the plural verb.

## Relative pronouns

Be careful while using relative pronouns such as *who, that*, and *which*.
*That* and *which* don't mean exactly the same thing and cannot be used interchangeably.

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The folder that is blue can be used. [/warning]  
This sentence describes a specific blue folder that can be used. *That* introduces a restrictive clause and isn't preceded by a comma.

[tip] **Recommended:** The folder, which is blue can be used. [/tip]  
This sentence describes a blue folder from a group of folders can be used. *Which* introduces a non-restrictive clause and is preceded by a comma.

Use *who* while referring to people instead of *that*. The possessive of *who*, *whose* can also be used for people, animals, and things.

**Examples**

[warning] **Not recommended:** Contact the developer that fixed the error. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Contact the developer who fixed the error. [/tip]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Refer the guide whose elements are cited. [/tip]  

## Pronouns and collective nouns

Avoid using pronouns like *they* for collective nouns. For example, *team* would take a singular pronoun. Rewrite the sentence using the appropriate pronouns.

## Possessive pronouns

Don't use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns.  

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The website is your's. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The website is yours. [/tip]  

## Ambiguities using pronouns

Ensure that the pronoun you're using is referencing its antecedent (the noun that it's replacing) clearly.

**Examples**

[warning] **Not recommended:** Create a new post with the plugin. You can see it on the blog page. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Create a new post with the plugin, You can see the post on the blog page. [/tip]  

[warning] **Not recommended:** The WordPress codebase can be accessed using Subversion and Git. Its repository is located at git://develop.git.wordpress.org/. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** The WordPress codebase can be accessed using Subversion and Git. The git repository is located at git://develop.git.wordpress.org/. [/tip]

[warning] **Not recommended:** Toggle this to *on.* [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Toggle this button to *on.* [/tip]

Use optional pronouns, such as that and who, to avoid ambiguity and clarify meaning in sentences.

**Examples**

[warning] **Not recommended:** Create the new post you want to see on the blog page. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Create the new post that you want to see on the blog page. [/tip]
