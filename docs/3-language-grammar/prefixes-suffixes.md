# Prefixes and suffixes

[info] **Highlight:** Don't use three or more affixes in a single word. [/info]  

A *prefix* is a letter or group of letters that are attached to the beginning of a word, whereas similarly, a *suffix* is attached to the end of a word. Attaching a prefix or suffix to a word is called *affixing*.

**Common suffixes**  
- *-able, -ible, -al, -ial, -ed, -en, -er, -er, -est, -ful, -ic, -ing, -ion, -tion, -ation, -ition, -ity, -ty, -ive, -ative, -itive, -less, -ly, -ment, , -ness, -ous, -eous, -ious, -s, -es, -y*

**Common prefixes**  
- *anti-, de-, dis-, en-, em-, fore-, in-, im-, in-, im-, il-, ir-, inter-, mid-, mis-, non-over-, pre-, re-, semi-, sub-, super-, trans-, un-, under-*

## General do's and don'ts

- Don't use three or more affixes in a single word. These words are difficult to comprehend for readers.
- Some affixes such as *under, less, able, super* can be complete words too. Apart from these, make sure to use affixes along with root words rather than using them separately as individual words.
- Only use hyphens when absolutely needed as most affixed words don't require hyphens. For more information and exceptions to hyphenation, see [Hyphens](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/style-guide/punctuation/hyphens/).
- If you're doubtful about using a hyphen, simply ask yourself if that would simplify or impede the reader. If it impedes understanding the word or context, don't use a hyphen. Typically, hyphens are used to make longer, complicated words easier to read.
