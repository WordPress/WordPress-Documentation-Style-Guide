# Prepositions

[info] **Highlight:** Use prepositions as needed, even at the ends of sentences. [/info]  

Use and place prepositions wherever necessary. It's completely fine to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves readability. Place the preposition in a reasonable position such that the reader easily understands the sentence.
Avoid prepositions that complicate sentences unnecessarily.

## Prepositional phrases

A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and the words that follow it. In a prepositional phrase, the object (the following words), may be a noun, pronoun, gerund, or clause.

**Example**  
[tip] **Recommended:** The preview shows how the page will look on the front end. [/tip]  

Avoid making long prepositional phrases. Long prepositional phrases are difficult to read and interpret.
