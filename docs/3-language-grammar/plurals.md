# Plurals

[info] **Highlight:** Pluralize a singular noun by adding *-s* at the end. [/info]  

## Plurals and nouns

If a singular noun ends without an *-s*, add an *s* at the end to get its plural form. If a singular noun ends with an *-s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, or -z*, add an *es* at the end to get its plural from. Additional information on plurals and their exceptions can be found [on Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/English_plurals).

## Plurals and numbers

To pluralize a number, add an *-s* at the end.
- The 2000s.
- Type five 7s.

Don't add an *s* in abbreviations of measurements to indicate plurality. For example, 50 mi or 10 mm; not 50 mis, 50 mi's, 10 mms, or 10 mm's.

## Plurals and abbreviations

Don't use apostrophes to form plurals of abbreviations. The plural of an abbreviation can be formed like any other regular term; if the abbreviation is for a singular noun, add a lowercase *s* to form its plural. If the abbreviation is for a plural noun, don't add an *s*. Also ensure that the possessive form of the word (an apostrophe *'* before the *s*) is not used.

## Plurals and symbols

Avoid pluralizing symbols, signs, and individual letters by adding an apostrophe and an *s* at the end.

[warning] **Not recommended:** Invalid characters include x's, $'s, @'s, and #'s. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Invalid characters include the letter *x* and the symbols $, @, and #. [/tip]  

## Plurals in parentheses

Don't put optional plurals in parentheses, rather use either the plural or singular form of the word. Determine a word form that is most appropriate for your documentation and stay consistent with its usage. If it is essential to indicate both, use *one or more*.
Avoid adding *(s)* to indicate the plural form of a variable. Use the plural form of its unit instead.
