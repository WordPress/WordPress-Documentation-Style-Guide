# Nouns

[info] **Highlight:** Capitalize proper nouns. Don't use verbs as nouns or nouns as verbs. [/info]  

A noun is a word used to identify people, places, or things (common noun), or particular person, place, or thing (proper noun).

## Proper nouns

Proper nouns are unique people, places, and things. Always capitalize proper nouns in sentences.  
Proper nouns include:
- Names and titles of individuals.
- Names of places.
- Brand names, names of organizations and companies.
- Software, product, application, and service names.
- Names and titles of works such as books, articles, songs, etc.
- Trademarks and standards.

## Common nouns

If there is more than one thing, then it is a common noun. Don't capitalize common nouns unless they are at the beginning of a sentence, or if the sentence implements title case capitalization. For example, there are multiple websites, so *website* is a common noun. But, *WordPress* is a unique website out of all of them, therefore, it is a proper noun.  

Common nouns include most product categories, devices, features, and technology concepts such as *email, laptop, machine learning, website,* and *server*.

## Verbs as nouns

Don't use verbs as nouns or nouns as verbs.
