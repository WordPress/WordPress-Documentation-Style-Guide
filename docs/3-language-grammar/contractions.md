# Contractions

A contraction is a shortened form of a word, syllable, or a combination of words that is often used instead of the full form in spoken English. Generally, the letters omitted by contractions are indicated with an apostrophe ( *'* ).  Contractions are commonly used in colloquial and informal settings.

As WordPress documentation makes use of a colloquial tone, you can utilize contractions in your content. Although, be watchful of some exceptions.  

**Examples**  

- *I'm - I am*.
- *they've - they have*.
- *don't - do not*.

## Common contractions

- Use common contractions such as *they've, that's, you're, it's*, in your documentation.
- Be wary of common mistakes such as confusing *you're* with *your*, and *it's* with *its*.
- Use negation contractions such as *don't, can't, shouldn't,* and *isn't*.
- Avoid awkward and unconventional contractions such as *where're, mightn't, mayn't, 'twas'*, and slang contractions like *gotta, imma, wanna*.

## Noun and verb contractions

Don't use contractions formed with nouns and verbs. Contractions formed with nouns and verbs are generally complex and uncommon words.  

**Examples**  

[warning] **Not recommended:** Gutenberg's using a new, refreshed UI.  [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** Gutenberg is using a new, refreshed UI. [/tip]

[warning] **Not recommended:** These formats've proven to be highly beneficial. [/warning]  
[tip] **Recommended:** These formats have proven to be highly beneficial. [/tip]  

## Double contractions

Avoid using double contractions. Double contractions contain two contractions as opposed to one.

**Examples**  

- *wouldn't've - would not have*.
- *you'd've - you would have*.
- *sha'n't - shall not (shall + n't)*.
- *mightn't've - might not have*.
- *'tisn't - it is not*.

Double contractions, including slang and archaic, are difficult to understand. Avoid using these in documentation.
