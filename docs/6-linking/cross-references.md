# Cross-references

Cross-references guide the reader to information related to the content. For additional information about internal and external references, see [Link text]() and [Capitalization in titles and headings]().

## References to other documents

Write relevant and meaningful link text.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: Click [here](https://wordpress.org/news/). [/warning]  
[warning] Not Recommended: See [documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/). [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: For the latest release announcements, see [News and Announcements](https://wordpress.org/news/).  [/tip]  

If the link text doesn't clearly specify as to why you're referring the reader to related information, then provide explanatory information. Make the explanation specific, but don't repeat the information text.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: For more information, see [WP-CLI Commands](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/). [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: For more information about all the available commands, see [WP-CLI Commands](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/). [/tip]  

If the link downloads a file, explicitly mention it, and the file type.

**Examples**  

[tip] Recommended: Get started with the installation process by [downloading the latest WordPress ZIP file](https://wordpress.org/latest.zip). [/tip]  

Don't include multiple links to the same document or article within a page. However, you can add a secondary link, if you're linking to a particular section of the document or if the page you're linking from is long. It is also acceptable to use a secondary link if there are multiple entry points to the document you're linking from.

## Cross-references within generated reference documents

In generated reference documents, while linking from one reference topic to another, use the standard linking syntax rather than hard-coding links within the reference, so that the links will change appropriately when the reference docs change.

## Writing cross-references

While writing descriptions for what the cross-references link to, use *about* instead of *on*.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: For more information on procedural steps that provide instructions to achieve a particular task, see [Procedures](). [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: For more information about procedural steps that provide instructions to achieve a particular task, see [Procedures](). [/tip]  

## Formatting cross-references

- Don't enclose cross-references that are links in quotation marks.
- In case the cross-reference isn't a link, use italics or quotation marks as appropriate.
  - Use italics for cross-references that are titles of full-length works such as a movie, book, or paper that are unlinked.  
  **Examples**  

  [tip] Recommended:  [/tip]  

  - Use quotation marks for cross-references that are short works such as a blog post or a TV episode, and document sections.
