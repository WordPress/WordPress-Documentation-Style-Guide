# External links

WordPress documentation is undoubtedly reliant on third-party standards, software, platforms and technologies. Moreover, third-party documentation may become obsolete after upgrades and updates, so there is always the possibility of WordPress documentation potentially referencing obsolete content. Hence, in order to provide abundant references and guidance, it is preferable to link to external sites and sources instead of quoting or rewriting existing documentation.

Although in some cases, including brief information can save the readers a trip to an external site.

**Example**  
[tip] **Recommended:** To create multiple paragraphs, use the `<p>` element rather than using the `<br>` element. For more information on which uses of `<br>` are correct and which ones aren't, see the [HTML specification for `<br>`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-br-element). [/tip]

Ensure that the sites you link to are of high standard and quality.

If the URL has a locale indicator, remove it and then test the link. For example, in a Wikipedia link, change the following:  
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC
```
to this:
```
https://wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC
```

Don't force links to open in a new tab or window. Let the reader decide how to open links. If the link needs to open in a new tab or window, notify the reader that the link will open in a new tab or window.  

**Example**  
[tip] **Recommended:** For more information, see the [American Heritage Dictionary (opens in a new tab)](https://ahdictionary.com/). [/tip]

Use an external link icon to indicate that the link goes to a different domain or server. For more information, see [Links to pages on a different domain or server]().
