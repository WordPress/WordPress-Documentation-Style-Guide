WordPress documentation is undoubtedly reliant on third-party standards, software, platforms and technologies. Moreover, third-party documentation may become obsolete after upgrades and updates, so there is always the possibility of WordPress documentation potentially referencing obsolete content. Hence, in order to provide abundant references and guidance, it is preferable to link to external sites and sources instead of quoting or rewriting existing documentation.

Although in some cases, including brief information can save the readers a trip to an external site.

**Example**  
[tip] **Recommended:** To create multiple paragraphs, use the `<p>` element rather than using the `<br>` element. For more information on which uses of `<br>` are correct and which ones aren't, see the [HTML specification for `<br>`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-br-element). [/tip]
