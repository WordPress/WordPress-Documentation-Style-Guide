WordPress documentation is undoubtedly reliant on third-party standards, software, platforms and technologies. Moreover, third-party documentation may become obsolete after upgrades and updates, so there is always the possibility of WordPress documentation potentially referencing obsolete content. Hence, in order to provide abundant references and guidance, it is preferable to link to external sites and sources instead of quoting or rewriting existing documentation.
