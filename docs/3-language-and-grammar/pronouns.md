# Pronouns

A pronoun is a word that is used as a substitute for a noun or a noun phrase, which are contextually understood. Pronouns are used so that a particular noun isn't repeatedly used.

## Personal pronouns

Avoid using personal pronouns such as *I, we, us, our,* and *ours* except in the following contexts:  
- Questions in FAQs.
- A document whose author makes comments in the first person.
- Using *we* to refer your organization or team, after using its name for the first time.

Use second person (*you*) instead of first-person pronouns.

## Pronouns and genders

Don't use gender-specific pronouns unless the person being referred actually uses that gender. If you're unsure which gender-specific pronoun to use, rewrite the sentence using second person (*you*).

Use gender-neutral pronouns while particularly avoiding binary pronouns such as *he, him, she, her, or renditions like s/he, he/she, or (s)he*.
Instead, use *they* as a gender-neutral pronoun.

## Relative pronouns

Be careful while using relative pronouns such as *who, that*, and *which*.
*That* and *which* don't mean exactly the same thing and cannot be used interchangeably.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The folder that is blue can be used. [/warning]
This sentence describes a specific blue folder that can be used. *That* introduces a restrictive clause and isn't preceded by a comma.

[tip] Recommended: The folder, which is blue can be used. [/tip]
This sentence describes a blue folder from a group of folders can be used. *Which* introduces a non-restrictive clause and is preceded by a comma.

Use *who* while referring to people instead of *that*. The possessive of *who*, *whose* can also be used for people, animals, and things.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Contact the developer that fixed the error. [/warning]

[tip] Recommended: Contact the developer who fixed the error. [/tip]

[tip] Recommended: Refer the guide whose elements are cited. [/tip]

## Pronouns and collective nouns

Avoid using pronouns like *they* for collective nouns. For example, *team* would take a singular pronoun. Rewrite the sentence using the appropriate pronouns.

## Possessive pronouns

Don't use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns.  

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: The website is your's. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The website is yours. [/tip]

## Ambiguities using pronouns

Ensure that the pronoun you're using is referencing its antecedent (the noun that it's replacing) clearly.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Create a new post with the plugin. You can see it on the blog page. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Create a new post with the plugin, You can see the post on the blog page. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: The WordPress codebase can be accessed using Subversion and Git. Its repository is located at git://develop.git.wordpress.org/.  [/warning]

[warning] Not Recommended: Toggle this to *on.* [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Toggle this button to *on.* [/tip]

Use optional pronouns, such as that and who, to avoid ambiguity and clarify meaning in sentences.
