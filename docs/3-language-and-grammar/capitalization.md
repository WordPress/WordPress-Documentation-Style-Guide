# Capitalization

WordPress follows American (US) English capitalization rules. In general, sentence case capitalization is used. Sentence case capitalization means capitalizing the first word of a sentence or a phrase and the proper nouns.

## General do's and don'ts

- Capitalize the first word of a sentence, phrase, heading, title, or any element.
- Always capitalize proper nouns. Proper nouns include, names, places, brand names, organizations, companies, software, products, services, and whatever the organizations deem to be capitalized. Use lowercase for everything else.
- If an official name, term, abbreviation, or code snippet begins with a lowercase, is all-uppercase, or a mix of both uppercase and lowercase, then don't alter it.
- Rephrase sentences that start with a lowercase term to avoid the lowercase term in the beginning.
- Don't capitalize words unnecessarily. If in doubt, don't capitalize the term.
- Don't use all-uppercase for emphasizing text. Also, don't use all-lowercase as a design preference. In both instances, text is difficult to read and it becomes difficult to distinguish between sentences.
- Avoid camel case, except while representing code or official terminology.
- While referencing or quoting external sources, use the original capitalization. Don't alter the capitalization even if it is incorrect.

## Capitalization in titles and headings

Use sentence-case capitalization in titles and headings. Capitalize the first word in the title or heading, sub-heading, any proper nouns, and official terms. If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the following word.

Lowercase all other words and terms. Don't end the title or heading with a period. For example, *'Creating a block for the Gutenberg block editor'*.

### Capitalization in references to titles and headings

When linking to a title, heading, or subheading as a reference from a document that follows this guide, use sentence-case capitalization even if the title or heading itself uses title case. That way, when the title or heading is eventually updated to sentence case, the reference will match.

In references to titles, headings, or subheadings that don't follow this guide or external sources, retain the original capitalization. For additional information about formatting third-party links, see [Formatting cross-references]().

## Capitalization in indexes and glossaries

Apart from proper nouns and official terminology, use lowercase for index and glossary terms. Use sentence case for glossary definitions.

## Capitalization in tables and lists

Use sentence case for tables, lists and all their elements.

## Capitalization and colons

Capitalize text after a colon if they are headings, titles, proper nouns, official terminology, and quotations. Use lowercase if the text following the colon is exclusive of this criteria.  

**Examples**  
- Directory structure: Home
- Block Editor: Making a Block
- Our founder: John D.

## Capitalization and hyphens

Capitalize only the first element in a hyphenated word, unless a subsequent element is a proper noun or proper adjective.

## Capitalization and illustrations

Capitalize terms using sentence case. Capitalize labels, captions, and other supplemental text in illustrations.

## Capitalization and slashes

For words using a slash, capitalize the word after the slash if the word before it is capitalized.  

**Examples**  
- *Region/Location*
- *Press the On/Off switch.*

## Title case capitalization

Title case capitalization may be used at times, depending on the context. Title case capitalization is sometimes used in article, book, or blog titles, research paper titles, and titles of people (such as *Managing Director*). In most cases, sentence case capitalization is used.
The general rules for title case capitalization are:
- Capitalize the first and last words.
- Capitalize all words including nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and pronouns.
- Don't capitalize articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) unless it's the first word.
- Don't capitalize prepositions such as *of, to, on, in, for*, etc. as long as they are four or fewer lettered words. Don't capitalize *but, or, yet*, etc. unless it's the first or last word.
