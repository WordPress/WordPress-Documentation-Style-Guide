# Contractions

A contraction is a shortened form of a word, syllable, or a combination of words that is often used instead of the full form in spoken English. Generally, the letters omitted by contractions are indicated with an apostrophe ( *'* ).  Contractions are commonly used in colloquial and informal settings.

As WordPress documentation makes use of a colloquial tone, you can utilize contractions in your content. Although, be watchful of some exceptions.  

Examples
- *I'm - I am*.
- *they've - they have*.
- *don't - do not*.

## Common contractions

- Use common contractions such as *they've, that's, you're, it's*, in your documentation.
- Be wary of common mistakes such as confusing *you're* with *your*, and *it's* with *its*.
- Use negation contractions such as *don't, can't, shouldn't,* and *isn't*.
- Avoid unconventional and awkward contractions such as *where're, mightn't, mayn't, 'twas'*, and slang contractions like *gotta, imma, wanna*.

## Noun and verb contractions

Don't use contractions formed with nouns and verbs. Contractions formed with nouns and verbs are generally complex and uncommon words.
