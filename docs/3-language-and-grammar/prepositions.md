# Prepositions

Use and place prepositions wherever necessary. It's completely fine to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves readability. Place the preposition in a reasonable position such that the reader easily understands the sentence.
Avoid prepositions that complicate sentences unnecessarily.

Examples
- Select the block you want the text to be copied to.

## Prepositional phrases

A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and the words that follow it. In a prepositional phrase, the object (the following words), may be a noun, pronoun, gerund, or clause.

Example
- The preview shows how the page will look on the front end.

Avoid making long prepositional phrases. Long prepositional phrases are difficult to read and interpret.
