# Writing inclusive documentation

The WordPress community is welcoming and inclusive. Write WordPress documentation considering inclusivity of people of all demographics.

## Unbiased documentation

Write documentation that is unbiased towards the reader and any kind of person in general. While documenting particularly demanding/sensitive topics, take the time to educate yourself thoroughly. Ensure that your document doesn't have content that may hurt or offend someone unintentionally.  

While writing unbiased documentation:
 - Be inclusive of gender identity, race, culture, ability, age, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class. Include a wide variety of professions, educational settings, locales, and economic settings in examples.
 - Avoid politicized content. In case political content is to be included, remain neutral.
 - Follow [Accessibility](/docs/2-document-guidelines/accessibility.md) guidelines.
 - Avoid content that would insult or cause harm to people.
 - Don't write prejudiced and discriminatory content against minority communities.
 - Avoid terms related to historical events.

## Avoid ableist and profane language

Be thoughtful of word choice - particularly slang and ableist language. Don't use slang, violent and derogatory language such as *dumbass* and *bitch*.

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: Gutenberg is damn useful stuff.[/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Gutenberg is a versatile editor.[/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: Only morons use this API. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Using this API is not advised.[/tip]

## Writing about genders

Use gender-neutral language, including pronouns. When writing about a real individual, use their preferred pronouns. Avoid gendered language such as *manpower*, *man-hours*, *chairman*, etc. Read additional guidelines on "Genders" and "Pronouns".  

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended:  
- manpower
- mankind
- chairman
[/warning]  

[tip] Recommended:
- human-power
- humankind/humanity
- chairperson

[/tip]

## Using diverse examples

Represent diverse perspectives and scenarios in text and media. Make use of inclusive and a diverse range of names, ages, locations, professions, and cultures while depicting people.
- Avoid making generalizations about people, religions, cultures, regions, and countries.
- Avoid unintentional racial and cultural bias while writing documentation.  

**Examples**  

[warning] Not Recommended: master/slave [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: primary/subordinate [/tip]  

## Accessibility and disability

- Research the terminology that the people with disability want to be identified with.
- Don't refer to people without disabilities as *normal, fit or healthy*; terms that would demean people with disabilities. This includes terms that are judgmental and victimize people with disabilities as *abnormal* or *sick*.
